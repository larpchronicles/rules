# Goblin Points

## Goblin Points - What Are They?


---

Goblin Point (GP) is a type of Out-Of-Character (OOC) currency in Chronicles.  They can be obtained by donation of time, such as event clean-up and NPC shifts or donation of items, such as packets, props, or supplies from the Chronicles Wishlist.  GP can be spent on a variety of things such as crafting materials, death forgiveness, and even Skill Point catch up for missed events.


## How Do I Get Goblin Points?

---

Goblin Points are awarded from plot and/or staff for contributions, donations, and assistance given.  They have a rough equivalent of 10 GP per $1 USD of value; however, you may not purchase them with direct cash donations.  There are special circumstances where this rate is increased.  You should always check with the plot team and/or staff about any special chapter needs!

## Getting the Most Out of Goblin Points

---

From time to time, the chapter may need some things more than others.  When this is true, specific listings will be tagged as “Needed” or “Critically Needed.”  These tags mean that the normal GP awarded for them is increased.

* **“Needed” Items.** These are items that if we do not receive or maintain on a semi-regular basis would impact the game quality significantly. Examples include: Packets, weapons, and tabards.
* **“Critically Needed” Items.**  These are items that are in an immediate need in order to continue running the game in the short term sense, we cannot run an event properly without an immediate donation of these items. Examples include: as per Needed, but assuming stock is extremely low, we have run out, all our supplies were lost, or similar.

## Donations of Time


---

**1 GP per - <u>Packet Creation during NPC Shift</u>**

* Time spent on packet creation during NPC Shifts is also rewarded!  For every packet crafted during a NPC shift, you will be rewarded an additional 1 Goblin Point.  For direct packet donation, see <u>Packet Donation</u> under <u>Item Donations</u>

**50 GP - <u>Event Set-Up and Clean-Up</u>**

* Event set-up and clean-up tasks include packet pick-up across the campsite, sweeping and/or mopping (if there is mud), loading or unloading NPC Camp, cleaning or organizing NPC Camp, cleaning dishes, taking trash to the dumpster, returning furniture to its rightful place, and in general, helping ensure that we return the campsite the way we found it or better.  If you provide this kind of help, be sure to let plot and/or staff know about it.

**50 GP - <u>Post Event Survey</u>**

* After each event is attended, you will have the option to subject a post-event survey to let staff and plot know about your experience so that they can use the feedback to improve the game overall or address any concerns.

**50-250 GP - <u>Plot Submissions</u>**

* Do you have an idea burning a hole into your head that you think would be a fun addition to Chronicles?  Did you spend time creating something unique and interesting that brings the world within Chronicles to life?  Great!  We love to hear about these and submissions of them, used or not, are rewarded.  This donation of time can include anything from writing mod card ideas, plotline writeups, creating in game news articles, in game artwork, and more!  Please absolutely send these in to [plot@larpchronicles.org](mailto:plot@larpchronicles.org) and be sure to ask how many Goblin Points it’s worth!

**100-600 GP - <u>NPC Shifts</u>**

* Goblin Point rewards gained for NPC Shifts differ depending on if someone is a Part Time NPC or a Full Time NPC.  For Part-Time, the option to claim Goblin Points (or a single Skill Point) is dependent on working a full shift of at least 3 hours.  Being a NPC has other rewards as well!  Be sure to read the NPCs & Benefits document for information on rewards, how often they can be claimed, and how to volunteer your time as a Part or Full Time NPC.
    * Part Time NPCs that work a full three hour shift can choose between 100 Goblin Points OR 1 additional Skill Point.  Regardless of the number of completed shifts, this may only be claimed once per event day and only if additional Skill Points are not claimed.  Assuming you have worked a full NPC shift for each event day, if an event is two days (six hours worked), you can choose to claim at most 200 GP or for three day events (nine hours worked), 300 GP at most.
    * A Full Time NPC that works the entire event is awarded 400 GP.  This does not apply to any player that PCs during the event.  For three day events, this is 600 GP.

**!?! GP - <u>Physical Representation Creation or Repair</u>**

* “Phys-rep” creation can include the creation of claw boffers, swords, shields, and/or props.  This donation of time does not require you to also provide the supplies and is rewarded as deemed by Plot and/or staff based on participation.  For already completed phys-rep donations, see Physical Representation Donation under <u>Item Donations</u>

**!?! GP - <u>Special Event Assistance</u>**

* From time to time, plot may ask one or more people for assistance in running mods outside of a NPC Shift.  This type of time donation qualifies as special event assistance and the amount of Goblin Points it rewards can vary greatly depending on the task asked of you!

**10 GP per $1 -<u> Physical Representation Supplies</u>**

*  Supplies for phys-reps donations are rewarded with 10 Goblin Points per $1 USD value, rounded up.  This means if you spend $9.34 on phy-rep supplies, it will count as $10 and you will be given 100 GP.  Not sure what kind of supplies to donate?  Here is a short list of preferred supplies:
    * Ultralight Cores of carbon fiber, kitespar tube, fiberglass tube, or wrapped graphite tube.  Aluminum cores are only used for polearms.  Diameter should be between .414-.610”.
    * Closed Cell Foam.  This can be pipe foam insulation and pool noodles and is used to pad the “blade” of a boffer.  It should have a wall of at least ⅝” thick.
    * Open Cell Foam.  Used for boffer tips, this is a less dense foam commonly found in fabric stores as fill for pillows or in hardware stores as pipe foam.
    * Kite Tape or nylon rip stop repair tape.  Preferred vendor - [FunWithWind](https://funwithwind.com/store/ListCategoriesAndProducts2.asp?idCategory=186&idparent=171)
    * [Dap Weldwood Contact Cement](https://www.amazon.com/00271-Weldwood-Original-Contact-Cement/dp/B0006MXRY8/ref=pd_di_sccai_2?pd_rd_w=gdI93&pf_rd_p=c9443270-b914-4430-a90b-72e3e7e784e0&pf_rd_r=NXDNHRFGZV673SHKBQWS&pd_rd_r=377eca45-f83c-4a21-a00f-3b4859ff9ab9&pd_rd_wg=MvJFD&pd_rd_i=B0006MXRY8&psc=1)
    * [EVA Foam](https://www.foambymail.com/XPE2/cross-linked-polyethylene-foam-2lb.html)
    * Duct tape or strapping tape.

**10 GP per $1 - <u>Chronicles Amazon Wishlist Item(s)</u>**

* If you make a donation through the chapter’s [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/28K7OWJ8ZWO60?ref_=wl_share), make sure that plot and/or staff are aware that it is coming from you – also so that they know to watch for the package!  Anything purchased from the Wishlist is worth 10 GP per $1, rounded up.  This means if you spend $9.34 on packet supplies, it will count as $10 and you will be given 100 GP.  If an item you purchased for the Chapter from the Wishlist has a comment of “Needed” or “Critically Needed,” then you will be granted extra GP as detailed at the top of this document.

**50 GP per 25 - <u>Packet Donation (25 count)</u>**

* Each count of 25 packets rewards 50 GP.  Do note that packet material must be a biodegradable, natural fiber cloth of approx 6”x6”.  Any color is acceptable, but there is a strong preference for white fabric, because it can be easier to find with UV flashlights, making post-mod clean up much easier.  Packet contents should be seeds and must not contain sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.  Millet is highly suggested for packet contents.  For donation of time during an event to create packets with provided supplies, please see Packet Creation in <u>Donations of Time</u>

**!?! GP - <u>Physical Representation</u>**

* Completed “phys-rep” donations can include the claw boffers, swords, shields, costumes, costume jewelry, and/or props.  Donation of these items is rewarded per item and starts at 10 GP.  Higher quality donations are rewarded with more GP at the discretion of plot and/or staff.  Always confirm your reward total at the time of donation!

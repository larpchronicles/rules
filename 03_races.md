## Brood

**Physical Description**:

Brood may appear with iridescent brown complexions with varied color markings, carapaces, and large claws.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 1 Year.


**Median Life Expectancy**: 9 Years.


**Maximum Lifespan**: 30 Years.


**Overview**:

Initially, all Brood were connected to each other through the Hive Mind and were drones with no distinctiveness of personality.  Beginning with a single Brood, the concept of individualism began to spread, and with it, a disconnect from the Hive Mind.  Many Brood were not able to withstand being severed from the Hive this way and did not survive.


Those that did were able to act with autonomy, adopted their own names, and continually sought ways to express their newfound individuality.  The Brood began painting and marking themselves with various colors and using this to create distinct appearances and a stronger sense of identity for themselves.


Overall, other races regard the Brood as a terrifying race capable of great destruction and the majority are unaware of any difference between the two types of Brood.  As their presence is likely to typically cause alarm and panic, it is incredibly rare to see one of these Brood within a town.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Innate Claws*: Built for battle and a readiness to defend themselves, Brood have a set of limbs with large claws.  Possessing such natural weapons, they are unable to take up the physical weapons of other races.  Passively, all Brood have natural claws that deal a base of 1 Physical and qualify for all Unarmed Martial Skills requiring Unarmed Combat.  Brood cannot wield any weapons other than shields.


*Rip Free*: Brood abhor the sensation of being trapped and when they find themselves in such a situation, they will do anything in their power to regain their freedom. Once per rest, a Brood may have one free usage of Escape Artist.


*Acidic Secretion*:  Along with being capable of great destruction in general, Brood have acidic blood that is capable of destroying items._  Once per day, a Brood may spend 60 seconds in concentration to destroy an item.


**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  All Brood player characters must use a different colored paint to add markings and may not only have brown or black paint.  The design and color of these markings is player choice.  Physical representations for the carapace should be present and may be colored brown or black and given an iridescent coating.

## Dwarf

**Physical Description**:

Dwarves appear with complexions ranging from pale to ebony and are commonly recognized by their full-beards and great, bushy eyebrows.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 30 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 150 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  250 Years.

**Overview**:

The Dwarven people of Evren are a sturdy race of people who hail from the mountainous regions.  Rarely given toward verbosity or activities they believe are unrefined and requiring improvement, Dwarves have received a reputation of being brusque and hypercritical.

This race once ruled a wide part of Evren with many villages filled with fantastic creations of ingenuity and inspired design.  Over half a millenia ago, when the Iblis invaded Evren, the Dwarven people suffered greatly, and lost control over much of their territories and their bastion of knowledge.  In the counter-attacks that ultimately pushed the Iblis back, the Dwarves were indispensable for their crafters.  Now, generations later, none truly remember the losses of their ancestors, and have long since turned their focus back toward building a vast mining empire and achieving ever greater levels of craftsmanship.


**Racial Abilities**:


*Improved Constitution*: Hardy and strong, Dwarves have a natural resistance toward many substances. Once per rest, a Dwarf may resist a toxin by calling “Resist Toxin.”


*Tricks of the Trade*: Dwarves are masters of all things crafting, and as such have learned how to cut the occasional corner. Once per day, a Dwarf may add 1 additional Durability to an item that is being created by themselves or another crafter.


**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Both male and female Dwarves appear with beards.

## Elf

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 50 Years.


**Median Life Expectancy**: 225 Years.


**Maximum Lifespan**:  250-300 Years.


**Racial Abilities**:


*Life Bound*: _Their long lives and vibrant life force makes them particularly resistant to negative spell effects._ Once per rest, an Elf may Resist Spell.


*Lore-Master*: _The longevity of the Elves means there are few stories that haven’t reached their ears_. Once per day, an Elf can attempt to recall something specific about an Evren area.  This must be done with Plot.

### Dark Elf

**Physical Description**:

Dark Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from white to pale.  They can sometimes be recognized by red markings around their eyes.

**Overview**:

The Dark Elven people primarily live deep below the surface of Evren.  Built within expansive networks of subterranean tunnels and caverns, their cities are elaborate and intricate wonders constructed long ago with a unique material that gives their constructions a glossy appearance like polished obsidian, but is much less brittle.

The Dark Elves themselves are known to be a bit xenophobic or isolationist, depending on the viewpoint. Socially, they are organized into matriarchal Houses.  Within their culture, the House you are born to or employed by is typically an indicator of overall status, as some are much more affluent  and influencing than others.

A Dark Elf with no such House affiliation is akin to an unknown.  In more polite circles, the avoidance of interaction is reasoned as not knowing how to properly address or interact with the Houseless individual, Elf or not.  More commonly, anyone lacking a House affiliation is generally seen as a non-citizen and thought to be a creature of no consequence with little to no importance and not worth direct attention.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  If a paler complexion is desired, it is recommended to use a lighter makeup foundation rather than to rely on white paint.  For the red eye markings, how they are added is player discretion and may be as simple as smudges, red eye-liner, lines, red eyeshadow, or no red markings at all.


---

### High Elf

**Physical Description**:

High Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from fair to ebony.

**Overview**:

High Elves are one of the most common Elves found in Evren.  Being more abundant across Evren, it should come as no surprise that these Elves frequently break down into regional or political groups such as Elves in the Red Desert often being referred to as “Desert Elves.”

The High Elves are typically perceived by others to be snobbish or elitist.  The reality of this is that they probably are.  Most, if accused of being elitist, would more than likely assert this as truth, as to deny it, in their views, would be akin to the delusion that High Elves are not superior to other Elves that, while Elf-shaped, are far too primitive and barbaric.


---

### Moon Elf

**Physical Description**:

Moon Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from white to pale.  They are typically recognized due to staining their skin with silver-colored dye.

**Overview**:

The majority of Moon Elves call Southwood home and live in a sprawling city where many buildings seem to have been grown from only silver and moonstone.

A widely held belief among the Moon Elves explains their practice of staining their skin silver: The Great Mother and Great Father formed the Elven race long ago, and in the birth of their race, the Mother's form exploded, becoming the stars in the night sky.  Forlorn without her, the Father transformed himself into the moon and joined her in the sky, but found he could not gaze upon only his beloved.

The Father turned his face upon Evren, providing a guiding light for their children at night and casting a pale, watchful face over them in the daytime. Each month, he will slowly turn away and face only the Mother to share a private moment away from the eyes of their children.

During this time of darkness, the sap of the central tree within their city turns silver.  It has become the practice of these Elves, each month, to mark the skin of their infants during their first new moon.  Many Elves continue to mark and stain their skin with the sap throughout their life, to mark everything from a coming of age to achieving spiritual growth.  The time of a new moon is a sacred time to the Moon Elves, as they believe it is the only time the Father and the Mother may create life again.

Their temperaments are varied, though most present themselves as stoic individuals with a quiet seriousness.  This behavior can sometimes appear as an attitude of aloofness or reserve.  The illusion is typically broken by the presence of someone the Moon Elf knows, prompting them toward displaying sudden warmth and openness.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Silver markings are largely up to the player.  Some examples of this may be flecks, lines, or the only visible color of the complexion.


---

### Sun Elf

**Physical Description**:

Sun Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from tan to a rich golden color.  They are often recognized by a golden sheen resulting from staining.

**Overview**:

The Sun Elves can primarily be found throughout the many islands of the archipelago.  Traveling from island to island, these Elves have become experts at navigation and utilize a unique mapping technique to map ocean swells with esoteric creations of sticks. shells, and twine.  Equipped with these stick maps, the knowledge to read them, and their massive catamarans, the Sun Elves live a transient, seafaring life.

The golden complexion of Sun Elves began long ago with a misguided belief that a particular gold mica laden cream would protect their skin from the harshness of the sun – a necessity for a people frequently under it.  Living mostly in small communities that frequently intermix, it is no surprise that the use of gold mica laden creams has become ubiquitous.  Today, the Sun Elves continue the practice of staining their skin as part of their naming ceremony as infants or any various coming of age tradition.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Achieving the golden complexion of a Sun Elf can typically be done with Mehron products.  It is not suggested to apply glitter due to the possibility of it getting in the eyes.


---

### Wild Elf

**Physical Description**:

Wild Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions from fair to ebony.  They are often recognized by visible markings or tattoos.

**Overview**:

Many of the Wild Elves – so named by the High Elves – make their homes either in Elven kingdoms or in the treetops of many Evren forests.  Regarded as masters of these untamed areas, they will frequently be referred to as rangers and are considered to be rather sneaky and elusive.  Equally, these Elves are frequently thought of as unnerving to face in a fight due to their use of ululating war cries.

The Wild Elves consider themselves to simply be better than others at living with nature and understanding its patterns rather than foolishly attempting to change nature to suit their own needs.  Even their homes, built upon platforms that sprawl from one tree to another, utilize the natural branching and existing foliage of the trees to support and camouflage their presence.

Socially, these Elves are broken down into various regional Groves, led by an elected council of five referred to as the Root.  Like the roots of a tree, the Root is responsible for supporting the Grove from the bottom up.  In an effort to maintain balance, each council member of the Root shares an equal say, which can sometimes result in changes as rapidly shifting as the weather or with a steady dependability.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Markings and tattoos can be done in any style desired by the player and in any color.

## 
Glimmerling

**Physical Description**:

Glimmerlings appear with a variety of complexions.  They are sometimes recognized by horns, antennae, wings, pointed ears, large noses, additional eyes, tails, etc.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 18 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 120 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  200 Years.

**Overview**:

Old wives tales will claim the Glimmerling people are the result of Humans having intermingled with the Fae of ancient legend.  Just as those stories contain many different descriptions, so too are the Glimmerlings wildly diverse in appearance and temperament.

Most people view the Glimmerlings with no difference to how they view the fairies of folktales, which is to say, there is very little open trust granted and more than a little suspicion.  This is of course aided by the tendency of many Glimmerlings to be merciless, mischievous tricksters – though in their opinion, they are simply having some fun and don’t all people like fun?

**Racial Abilities**:

*Remembrance*: Being connected to the realm of dreams, Glimmerlings are able to delve into the memories of another person. Once per rest, a Glimmerling may concentrate and establish a connection to a consenting character and aid them in recovering memories for as long as the other chooses to keep the contact.  This is a purely roleplayed ability and may not be used to determine truth.  If attempting to use this ability to recall specific plot information, seek a plot member beforehand, so they can be on hand to describe what you witness.

*Trickster*: Glimmerlings as a race, are very cunning and crafty and delight in causing the occasional confusion and chaos. Once per day, a Glimmerling may recall to a pre-designated location ala the same rules as Rune of Recall and call, “Activate Recall, 1 I recall, 2 I recall, 3 I recall.”  They must drop any items acquired prior to vanishing.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Physical representations of any unique characteristics should be done.

---
## Goblin

**Physical Description**:

Goblins appear with green complexions, pointed ears, and long, pointed noses that may have large warts.  Most Goblins are bald, but it is common to see them in gaudy wigs.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 5 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 30 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  60 Years.

**Overview**:

Hailing from nearly all reaches of Evren, Goblins are descendants of a race once imbued with magic and connected to a protective and empowering being their shamans refer to as the All-Father.  While each tale will likely vary as to why they are no longer linked to any such creature, Goblins today do not look at this as some kind of loss, but rather that they are much stronger without the fetters of dependency.

Resourceful and clever, if not traditionally wise, Goblins are unreservedly proud of their achievements.  The scale or scope of the achievement rarely factors in, so long as, to their perception, something was completed in a way that brought them satisfaction.  Sharing such gratification with others, or worse, being forced to credit another for their accomplishment is not only demoralizing, but often treated as an affront and impugnment of their person.

In ages long since past, Goblins were subjugated and enslaved by Orcs on the heels of the Orcs themselves having gained their own freedom.  This lasted for about as long as it took Goblins to outsmart the Orcs, which is to say, not very long.  Still, a bitterness toward Orc-kind remains today in many Goblin communities.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Improvised Equipment*: Exceptionally enterprising in a pinch, Goblins are innovative and quick-thinking individuals that are undaunted by a “broken” piece of equipment.  Once per rest, a Goblin may use a weapon, shield, or piece of armor that is broken until their next rest.  After this use, the item crumbles and may not be repaired or salvaged.

*Run Away*: Being so incredibly clever sometimes has its pitfalls, and the sudden need to “get out of dodge” is a unique skill all Goblins seem to develop.  Once per day, a Goblin may elect to flee an encounter by yelling, “RUN AWAY!”  For 10 seconds, this Goblin may Dodge an unlimited number of times, but must be physically fleeing.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Achieving pointed ears that slope back or downward can be done by wearing Elf ears backwards.

---
## Kindred

**Physical Description**:

Individuals appear with a variety of complexions, markings, and body parts.  They are recognized most commonly by appearing as a distinct humanoid-animal hybrid.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 30 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 150 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  250 Years.

**Overview**:

A fairly rare sight in Evren, the Kindred are the most diverse of the races in the sense that there are many different types, each appearing as an anthropomorphic form of another creature.  Being such wildly varied people, it should come as no surprise that their cultures, beliefs, appearances, and practices will all differ from one to another.  What the Kindred do share is the common trait of perseverance in the face of animosity.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Ferocity*: Kindred may call upon their inner ferocity to power their blows. Once per rest, a Kindred can announce “Ferocity” to activate this ability, adding +5 weapon damage against one enemy.  A Kindred under this effect may not retreat and is immune to fear and charming effects. Lasts 5 minutes.

*Begin the Hunt*: Possessing similar strengths to the creatures they resemble, many Kindred have become adept at honing and relying on their instincts or acute senses.  Once per day, a Kindred may focus themselves and enhance an existing purchase of Tracking by 1 additional Slot.  If the Kindred has 0 Tracking, they may use an assumed 2 for this ability.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Facepaint and physical representations should be present and match the animal-type for your specific Kindred.

---

## Kobold

**Physical Description**:

Kobolds appear as reptilian humanoids with red or blue scaled complexions, black nostrils, blackened eye sockets, and an elongated, flattened snout akin to caiman or crocodiles.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 3 years

**Median Life Expectancy**: 7 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  15 Years.

**Overview**:

Kobolds can typically be found living in small, roving clans or in rustic, out of the way settlements. From the outsider’s perspective, Kobolds and their communities are grossly lacking in laws and rife with theft.  This extends to the belief that the primary interests of every Kobold fall to impulsively gathering up anything interesting or shiny that isn’t nailed down hard enough to keep them from making off with it and with the thing it is nailed to.  That is to say, most people believe that to Kobolds, there are only two properties of ownership:  “mine and things I don’t care about.”

Bright-eyed and precocious, Kobolds are among the shortest lived races, with all the chaotic cleverness and volubility it takes to get by.  When it comes to their supposed kleptomania, the majority of Kobolds will vehemently dispute any such accusation.

Kobolds typically respect the notions of ownership and possession, for anything they have an emotional attachment to is something they consider theirs and they would go to great lengths to keep it that way.  For everything else, a Kobold is likely to tell you that possession is entropic.

The worth most Kobolds place on things has very little to do with its intrinsic value or utility and everything to do with whether or not the object has captured their attention and or imagination. Uniquely held concepts such as this persist among most Kobolds, often presenting views and ideas about the world around them and how it works with a perceived naivety or ingenuousness.

**Racial Abilities**:

*MY SHINY* - Kobolds are distinctly aware of the entropic nature of having things and so will closely guard things that are of great importance to them – or things that are important to them today.  Once per rest, a Kobold may declare one item on their person as protected, preventing the item from being taken from them, even in death.  This status lasts only until the start of their next rest, when they may declare another thing.  If the protected item is a container, only the container is protected, nothing inside of it.

*Ooo, Shiny* - Kobolds are well-known for their impulsive nature of taking things they believe are interesting or needed.  Once per day, a Kobold may scrounge up a random item.  This must be done with Plot.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  The particular shade or hue of blue or red is up to the player.  The eye sockets should be blacked out up to the eyebrows and may extend to create angular shapes.  The nostrils should be black and come to small triangular tips just above the nostril.  Physical representations for horns and tails are encouraged.

## Orc

**Physical Description**:

Orcs appear with green complexions and are recognized by their protruding lower teeth.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 15 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 40 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  80 Years.

**Overview**:

Like the grassy streaks that never seem to quite wash out of that favorite pair of pants, a viridian stain of Orcish clans spread across the central lands of Evren.  Most of the other races steer clear of them, though it is not unheard of to find pockets of Goblins existing either among them or in villages situated somewhere an Orc claims as their territory.

The capital-D Dominance-based culture of these Orcs is more than just how their hierarchical society gets structured, it is a way of life that comes more naturally than breathing.  With this consideration, some other races may be confused at how Orc society has become matriarchal until one stops to consider that the needs and urges that feed into this culture are present within Orcs even as children, and who would they most likely challenge but their own caretakers?

The basis of this culture does not hinge much on codes of honor or only fighting “the right way.”  To most Orcs, the way to establish Dominance is to do whatever it takes to still be standing and if that involves trickery and cunning, then that is exactly how they’ll accomplish it.  After all, they learned all about the value of outsmarting their opponents from the Goblins they once subjugated.  But, Orcs do not exactly pride themselves on being smarter than their opponent, just being strong enough to make their opponent dumber by way of repeated blows to the head.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Rub Dirt In It*: Orcs are strong and their beliefs are as strong, if not stronger.  In fact, an Orc’s faith in their own toughness and ability allows them the firm certainty that cramming a wound full of dirt is a sure way to heal it – but only small wounds, and only sometimes.  Once per rest, an Orc may restore a dying character to 1 Health Point/Body.

*Last Stand*: Like an Orc’s faith in dirt’s ability to heal, an Orc has an even truer faith in themselves to outlast even the limits of their bodies.  Once per day, an Orc may take their last stand and become immune to everything for 10 seconds.  After use, the Orc falls over dead and requires a Life/Revivify spell.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Protruding lower teeth should be physically represented in addition to a green complexion.

---

## Halfling

**Physical Description**:

Halflings have complexions that may range from fair to ebony, slightly pointed ears, and are often recognized by hair feet, hairy forearms, and long sideburns.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 30 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 90 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  150 Years.

**Overview**:

Typically rather practical, Halflings are community-oriented people that relish a good challenge or being presented with a new task to bend their considerable, natural intellect toward.  They are often viewed as rather industrious due to their advances in homestead technologies and it is not uncommon for a Halfling to be seen working on a city planning council or to be sought out as a consultant for a variety of tasks.

Most often, Halflings make their homes in multi-race towns and villages, though all-Halfling communities certainly exist and are likely one of the most functional, well-run places it is possible to encounter.

The values held by the majority of Halflings are the home, the belly, and the mind – in that order, of course.  Without a home, there is not a place in which to feed the belly.  If you cannot feed the belly, then you cannot aptly use the mind.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Nimble Feet:* Halflings are known for having an uncanny talent for guessing exactly where that tree is going to fall or which way that box is going to explode.  Once per rest, a Halfling may Dodge any standard trap that has a tag.  This ability is treated as a DODGE effect and use of it may be called before or after a trap has been set off.

*Community Outreach*: The community is where the home is, and the belly, and the mind.  As such, it comes as no surprise that aiding the community is a talent that comes naturally to many Halflings. Once per day, a Halfling may substitute their ranks in Cooking, Performance, or Gambling with an equal number of ranks in a different Rest-boosting skill. Alternatively, they may boost the ranks of another’s Rest-boosting skill by +2.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Sideburns and excess hair can appear on all Halflings and should be physically represented in some visible manner.

---
## Human

**Physical Description**:

Humans may appear with complexions ranging from pale to ebony and may have varied markings or identifiers based on their region or culture.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 18 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 60 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  100 Years.

**Overview**:

Humans have been around Evren for as long as anyone can remember, and though their lifespan is not as lengthy as some races, they nevertheless make up for in the structures they establish, leave behind, reclaim, and rebuild.  They are a fairly common sight in nearly every region, as at some point, their natural inclination toward wanderlust will take over some individuals who strike out and begin yet another community somewhere new.

From their own perspectives, Humans are tenacious, steadfast, full of determination, and always striving toward greatness – though the exact definition of what greatness is will always vary.  Building villages into towns and cities, then establishing laws and governing entities are the main strengths of Humans and in their expert opinion, are things they do for the betterment of all races and helps establish fairness.

Outside opinions of Humans are perhaps not as gilded, as many other races would describe Humans as greedy, controlling creatures that wander about, declaring any open plot of ground their new property.  Expecting all others to follow any laws and regulations they set forth, and having the amazing gall to refer to themselves as the “normal-looking ones.”  Not all opinions of Humans boil down to this perspective, of course.  There are plenty of people that happily coexist within Human towns that have become melting pots of mixed cultures and races.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Survivor*: Humans are incredibly adaptable and able to survive when most others would not. Once per rest, a Human may have a free usage of Endurance by spending 60 seconds of concentration to prime the ability. While primed, if the user reaches 59 seconds of their Dying count, this ability triggers to return the target to 1 Body instead of becoming Dead, and the user must declare “Endurance”. This is an ENDURE effect. An individual cannot have more than one primed ENDURE effect at once.

*Connected*: Humans are the most prevalent race on Evren and their propensity for establishing contacts across all walks of life is a trait many have become adept at within both the underworld and legitimate enterprises. Once per day, a Human may locate an impromptu black market in which only the character can enter.  This must be done with Plot.

___
## Unbound

**Physical Description**:

Unbound appear with complexions of blue, red, orange, brown, or grey with bright streaks, lines, or cracks of glowing power.  These lines typically appear as white or as more luminous colors of their complexions.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 20 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 90 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  150 Years.

**Overview**:

When asked about their origins, most Unbound are unlikely to have an answer.  Those that do, will likely speak of an ancient tale about an event known as The Night of Madness.  Half a millennium ago, there existed a people called the Taitrel.  The Taitrel appeared quite similarly to Humans, yet with startlingly bright eyes in icy blues, fiery reds and oranges, stone greys, earthy browns, and electric yellows.

For the Taitrel people, The Night of Madness began with a chaotic wave of elemental force that washed across their lands, decimating their population and reducing their homes to rubble.  Those that survived this incident, found themselves to possess bodies with complexions in the very same colors they once attributed as simple eye colors.  Bright lines of power rippled across their newly colored forms line veins of pure, luminous, elemental power.  The Taitrel were no longer.  They had become something else – something more.  Something unbound.

Though scattered all about Evren, it did not take long for the refugees to find each other.  Faced with rampant xenophobia bred by the continent-spanning Godslayer Wars, the Unbound banded together and carved out small territories for themselves.  These small territories grew into factions, typically led by individuals with exceptional qualities that aligned with what is most valued by a particular faction.

The Unbound that may be found alone are typically those that have established themselves as civil-minded mediators and advisors among other races, despite their somewhat fearsome appearance.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Elemental Blood*: The Unbound can tap into their elemental nature to either spend their vitality to attack others or they may absorb the elemental energies from an incoming attack, and be healed by it. Once per rest, Unbound may spend X number of body to use as a packet delivered spell (“Spell X*2 &lt;Element>”).  Alternatively, they may instead receive healing from an incoming attack of the character’s chosen element.(“Appears to Heal Me”).

*Elemental Transmutation*: The Unbound are amalgamations of elemental forces and living beings. As such they are able to tap into the makeup of matter. Once per day, an Unbound may transmogrify a single component of any rank into a different, single component of the same rank.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: To make glowing lines of power, it’s suggested to use white paint and either line it with a thin black line or put a thin line of color through the middle of the white in order to create a colored line that appears to glow.  Facepaint aside from the glowing lines should match the elemental type of your character.  Ie:  Fire should be red or red-orange tones and hues, electricity should be grey, but may be blue, water should be blue, and stone should be earthy browns or rocky grey. 

---
## Unforgiven

**Physical Description**:

Unforgiven appear with a red complexion with smoky black shadowing, black horns that sprout from the skull or face, and a thin barbed tail.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 20 Years

**Median Life Expectancy**: 90 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  130 Years.

**Overview**:

Over half a millennium ago, during the Godslayer Wars, the Iblis people opened an inter-planar gate from their home to Evren, through which they staged an invasion of what is now known as the Khuurai Steppe and the region north of Lac Gronk.  Their appearance was more than enough to initially terrify most and for many years, they roamed the western lands, bringing battle to those that chose not to flee.

Their conquest was short-lived, however, as they lacked the organization to unite their territories in a lasting empire. Their relentless advance was eventually halted, then reversed as a series of brutal counter-attacks from their neighbors crippled the overextended invaders.  Too intensely pressured by the creatures they had initially thought of as little more than sport, the horned invaders fled back through their gate, hastily closing it.  Many of the Iblis were left stranded, forced to face the mercy of a world they had shattered.

Persecuted by the angry Evrens, the numbers of the unintentional refugees dwindled as more and more of them went into hiding and the Iblis became convinced of one thing:  they would never be forgiven by the people of Evren.  Generations passed and as the memories of these events faded into legend, so, too, did the stigma formerly attached to the name they had taken:  Unforgiven.

A rare sight today, the Unforgiven began appearing again and integrating themselves into other societies.  While some may be put off by their appearance and liken them to old stories of demons, they are generally accepted in mixed-race towns and cities.  In these scarce sightings, the Unforgiven will have typically become a distinguished individual of either exceptional skill or of singular intelligence and wit.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Call To Darkness*: Most Unforgiven today likely owe their very existence to their ancestors’ cultivation of slipping away into their own shadow.  For some, this may seem like a trick of the eyes or that an Unforgiven has managed to hide away in plain sight; however, they remain very much visible, but for a short time, enjoy the safety the darkness grants them.  The aptitude for managing such a feat remains prevalent even into modern times.  Once per rest, an Unforgiven may spend 5 seconds in Concentration in order to slip into their own shadow and take the INVULNERABLE effect for 1 minute.  Within their own shadow, an Unforgiven is unable to move, communicate with others, nor use items or skills.  The Unforgiven is immune to all game effects, except SOLIDIFY and Dispel Magic.

*Guileless Contrac*t:  Motivated by either their own amusement or safety, Unforgiven have an unabashed penchant for deceiving and deluding others; however, when it comes to moments where the truth matters, they become intensely serious and many have learned to focus their will toward ensuring such moments are devoid of falsehoods.  Once per day, an Unforgiven can enact a binding contract between themselves and a consenting individual that lasts for 10 minutes.  During this time, neither party can intentionally tell a lie to the other person.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Horn sizes and placements may vary at player discretion, but should be black or dark in color.  Some Unforgiven players choose to “hide” their barbed tail, but otherwise this should also be physically represented.

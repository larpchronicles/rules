This proposal aims to make Rogues an interesting and dynamic class, with a real reason to exist in the game.

## Objective ##
To transform the Rogue class into a "Scout"-like archetype, with a heavy focus on ranged combat, while still being able to be somewhat of a Jack of All Trades.

## Key Points ##
- Significantly increase the cost of spells for Rogues
- Ranged Weapon proficiencies 
    - _(Consider: +2 damage instead of +1)_

    

## Ideas ##
- Rogues use Devious Points
- Rogue "perk": Ranged weapon profs (or all profs?) count for 2x from behind
- Rogues do not need to restring bows after blocking

Current Abilities
- Hamstring (Slow)
- Pinning projectile (Physical Entangle)
- Split Projectile (2 packets)
- Vital Blow (30 vital)
- Volley (3x 20 Normal Vital)

Potential:
- Blind
- Sleep
- Silence
- Kneel
- Halt
- Disarm
- Destroy
- Stun
- Marked Target (Curse of Destruction)


- **Break Free**: Once activated, character cannot be slowed, slept, entangled, bound, etc. for 10? seconds
- **Slippery**: Per purchase skill that allows character to be immune to damage during a movement-related 3-count (ex: cannot be damaged during Limited Teleport)
    - _(Status effects would still affect the character)_
- **Volley** rework: Throw Vital against 1 target, 5 minutes.
- **Ballista**: Throw Vital (or increased damage?) as long as feet stay planted
- I've Got It Here Somewhere...: Roleplay searching your pockets for 10 seconds, then produce a single standard consumable production item. It must be used immediately.
    - _(Number of ranks purchased determines max tier of item that can be produced)_
- **Mimicry**: With 5 seconds of seeing another character use an expendable, standard, SP-purchaseable skill, user may announce "Hold My Beer", then use the same ability.
- **Weapon ~~Master~~**: Able to use Ranged Profs as melee profs (+1) against a single target
    - Able to use a weapon without the skill against a single target
- **Acting!**: For one encounter, character appears as chosen race 
    - _(Want to avoid this being used to circumvent racial makeup requirements)_
- **Assassinate**: 100 Vital
A

Agility skills (vs Stamina skills)



Fighter Abilities:
- All profs are master profs
- All Martial Skills can be used with any melee weapon




- Devious Weapon Proficiency may be used without being behind the target, as per Weapon Proficiency, at half effect rounded down.
  - Ex: Shadowdancer has 5 Devious Weapon Proficiencies. They can swing for +10 damage behind a target and +2 damage in front of a target.

- Character may not purchase or use any Weapon Proficiencies other than Devious Weapon Proficiency. Character may not purchase Critical Strike abilities.
- Devious Strike abilities count as their associated Critical Strike abilities for pre-requisite purposes

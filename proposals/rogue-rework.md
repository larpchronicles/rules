# Agility Skills System and Rogue Rework 2023 #

# Objective #
To transform the Rogue class into a "Scout"-like archetype, with a heavy focus on ranged combat, while still being able to be somewhat of a Jack of All Trades.

# **TL;DR** _(Summary)_ #
- Introduced new Agility ability and Agility Pool
    - Similar to Stamina, but focus on Ranged combat, backstabs, and utility.
- New ability: Mimicry. Allows the character to mimic most spells and Stamina skills.
- New Ability: Resourceful. Allows "summoning" a consumable production item on the fly
- New Effect: Breach Armor. Reduces target's armor value to 0
- New Effect: MINIMIZE [effect]. Allows a character to end the specified effect on themselves with a 3-count
- Playtesting Murder as the only insta-kill ability (it has restrictions, see below)
- Playtesting Dodge as an Agility Ability, requires 2 Defense Slots, cannot stack
- Thrown Weapons get 2x benefit from Proficiencies (PENDING APPROVAL)

# Devious Skills
## Mimicry
Mimicry allows the character to use any single Spell or Stamina ability once per purchase of Mimicry. The character must expend a number of Agility Points equal to double the mimicked spell's Mana Point cost or Stamina Point cost, as appropriate.
Verbal: "My turn! ... <ability verbal/incant>"

|----------------|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Mimicry        | 5+10 | 20+10 | 3+5 | 20+10 |

| Cost per 10 Agility | 10+10 | 20+10 | 5+5 | 20+10 |

### Agility Abilities
- The Agility Point cost of each ability is equal to its level
- Characters may "memorize" their Agility Abilities at Rest for a 10% bonus to their Agility Pool (same as spells, and stamina) 
- **NOTE**: ***These are the ONLY abilities that have an Agility Point cost. If it is not in this table, it does NOT require Agility Points!***

# Agility Proficiencies 2023 #

# Objective #
To add a way for Rogues to reliably get access to damage without _requiring_ Stamina, and making the playstyle more Unique.

# **TL;DR** _(Summary)_ #
- Weapon Proficiencies will now only apply to Melee weapons.
- Agile Proficiencies will have the same effect as Weapon Proficiencies, but will only apply to
  - a) Ranged Weapons or 
  - b) Short Weapons when attacking the target from behind. 
    - This will stack with any Weapon Proficiencies the user has.

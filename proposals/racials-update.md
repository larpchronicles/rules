# The Goal #
Our goal is to produce more compelling and less confusing racial abilities across the board. Some of our races already have impactful and more importantly flavorful racials, and the ones you do not see above are currently considered to be in a good place, both in terms of balance and in representation among our playerbase. We hope the changes above can achieve three goals.
1) Reduce complexity of previously unmanagable or confusing Racials (Guileless Contract, Connected, and Loremaster come to mind.)
2) Provide engaging abilities that help define each race's strengths in a mechanical sense.
3) Provide abilities that are fun to utilize and are not easily forgotten by players.

# Brood #
Our goal with the brood update is a quick and easy one. The Brood's Innate Claws ability has been updated to allow Brood to Duel-Wield claws without having to purchase the Dual Wield skill. It also allows for Brood to utilize Ranged Weapons. Our goal here was to provide the ability for a Brood Player to pursue several different game play styles, not simply single short claws.

# Dwarf #
With Dwarves, with the Defense Slot update we felt it necessary to move away from the previous "Single Resist Toxin", which was not only not particularly compelling, but we felt could be greatly improved. With the introduction of the new Minimize keyword, we felt this was a strong fit for their new racial ability: Body of Stone.

*Body of Stone*: Hardy and strong, Dwarves have a natural resistance to physical influences. Once per rest, a Dwarf may reduce a Physical Effect upon themselves to three seconds by incanting "Minimize Physical"

# Elf #
With Elves, we ended up needing to review and eventually replace both of the racial abilities. The previous "Lifebound" racial had the same issues as Dwarves Resist Toxin, where not only was it not particularly compelling, but it didn't fit with our new format. Furthermore, Loremaster was a strong contender for replacement due to the burden it placed on Plot and the inconsistency with which it could be beneficial. As such, we've now replaced their racials with Will of Ages, and Ritual Expertise.

*Will of Ages*: _Their long lives and vibrant life force makes them particularly resistant to negative spell effects._ Once per rest, an Elf may reduce a Spell Effect upon themselves to three seconds by incanting "Minimize Spell"


*Ritual Expertise*: _The longevity of the Elves means that they often are able to find improvements in otherwise flawed Rituals_. Once per day, an Elf may reduce the Spirit Gem cost of a single ritual, to a minimum of one Spirit Gem. A single Ritual may not benefit from this ability more than once.

# Kindred #
With Kindred, this was another race where we felt the need to review and eventually replace both of the current racials. This group is well represented in our game currently, but the general consensus we received was that the current racials were not particularly interesting or engaging, and in fact often simply forgotten about. We have introduced two new racials in the hopes our Kindred players find them more compelling to have and utilize. Increased Metabolism and Invoke Instinct.

*Increased Metabolism*: Kindred's physiology is impressively streamlined, allowing them sometimes shake off Toxins that might often incapacitate them. Once per Rest a Kindred may reduce a Toxin Effect upon themselves to three seconds by incanting "Minimize Toxin"

*Invoke Instinct*: All Kindred possess a powerful connection to their primal pasts, and can instill those primal instincts in their prey. Once per day, a Kindred may invoke the fear of the hunt in a target by incanting "Aether Halt", preventing their target from advancing.

# Halfling #
Another dual-replacement race, both of the Halfling racials were in need of revision. Nimble feet was very thematic but was so niche as to be relatively non-existent, and with the recent changes to Rest skills, the old iteration of Community Outreach would've been a non-ability. As such, we've now introduced Make Myself At Home, and updated Community Outreach.

*Make Myself At Home:* Halflings are exceptionally light-fingered, and have little concept for such mundane things as "personal space". Once per Rest, a Halfling may spend 60 seconds of Roleplay to pick a single lock of any difficulty.

*Community Outreach*: All Halflings have a strong sense of community, and may use that connection to provide protection to their friends and loved ones. Once per Day, a Halfling may spend a minute of roleplay telling stories, singing a song, or sharing a meal, to deliver a single "Voice Radius Magic Barrier" of a type of their choosing.

# Human #
For humans our change here was a relatively small one. The previous daily ability "Connected" was essentially non-functional by this point anyway, so the decision was made to cut it. Currently, there is no replacement for it, as the committee felt that humans having a single racial was a fair trade-off for not having any further costuming requirements. This is not by any stretch a final decision and we are open to suggestions or feedback.

# Unforgiven #
Last but not least, Unforgiven had our second-most troublesome ability after Loremaster in Unforgiving Contract. While thematically appropriate, and mostly well received by the playerbase, it was generally viewed as a somewhat problematic ability due to the metagaming concerns, and our general distaste for active "mental control" abilities and their poor ability to be appropriately implemented in a LARP setting. As such, we have replaced it with Harvest Essence.

*Harvest Essence*:  Creatures of the Ether, Unforgiven have a stronger connection to the spiritual essence of other creatures than most, and use that connection to help them collect Spirit Gems. Once per day, an Unforgiven may deliver a single "Magic Entrap Spirit"

# **Monstrous Ability Transform Ritual Overhaul** #

## **Current Problems**
- Before being able to actually use any transform power, a character must:
    1) Perform the Spirit Familiar ritual
    2) Obtain a scroll for the transform they want
    3) Perform the Spirit Familiar Transform ritual
    4) Obtain a copy of the Monstrous Ability scroll they want
        - Obtain any specific components necessary for that ritual
    5) Perform the Monstrous Ability ritual to unlock the ability
    6) Spend the SP required to use the ability
- So we are gating transform abilities behind:
    - 3 rituals
    - 1-3 fetch quests (transform, ability scroll, required component)
    - Spirit gems
    - Skill Points
- Transforms have a minimum of 15 unlockable abilities. With the current system, that would require 15 different rituals and 93 spirit gems.
    - _If half the players in the chapter did this, it would be well over 200 rituals and 1400 spirit gems. Ain't nobody got time for that._
- It's really unsatisfying/disappointing as the player to have to jump through this many hoops, many of which require specific attention from the plot team.


## **Proposal**
1) Allow the Transform ritual to be cast without first requiring Spirit Familiar.
    - A character being bestowed their transform by another source would still require the Spirit Familiar ritual
        - Must be cast prior to receiving the transform, or by the event after they receive their transform.
2) Eliminate all Monstrous Ability Scrolls
3) "***Unlock Transform Abilities***" Ritual Scroll
    - Each participant in the ritual may benefit from its effect
        - _Partcipants must meaningfully contribute to the roleplay of the ritual, only the caster(s) require ranks of Ritual Magic_
    - Ritual is 1st level, and requires 1 Spirit Gem to cast plus 1 Spirit Gem for each character to be affected by the ritual
    - Unlocks an arbitrary number of transform abilities for each participant
    - Each ability unlocked requires a number of spirit gems based on the tier of the ability, to be paid by the affected character:
        - Basic - 1 Spirit Gems
        - Advanced - 2 Spirit Gems
        - Expert - 3 Spirit Gems
        - Master - 4 Spirit Gems
        - Grandmaster - 5 Spirit Gems
        - Mythical - 6 Spirit Gems
        - _Some abilities may have specific required components in addition to their Spirit Gem cost_

### Reasoning ###
- This would substantially reduce the number of rituals each character has to perform, and allowing multiple people to benefit from a single casting of the ritual reduces the burden on ritual marshals.
- It reduces the total number of spirit gems required to unlock all transform abilities (on average) to about 46.
- It is my hope that reducing the number of rituals will also have the benefit of allowing people to do more elaborate and impressive RP for their rituals.
    - _Not that they have been lacking so far, but creativity is going to wear thin long before a person reaches their 15th monstrous ability ritual._

Characters that have already performed Monstrous Ability rituals will still have those abilities unlocked. The difference between the spirit gem cost that they paid and the new cost may be used to unlock additional abilities immediately (no ritual required), or "banked" to be used for an "Unlock Transform Abilities" in the future. _(They will not be paid out as spirit gem tags.)_

### Spirit Bottle ###
Unlocking and purchasing the Spirit Bottle ability also creates your spirit bottle.  Once purchased, the Spirit Bottle ability may not be "unlearned" by any means except the **Reclaim Spirit Bottle** ritual _(doesn't exist yet)_.

Performing the **Refresh Spirit Bottle** _(doesn't exist yet)_ ritual will restore your spirit bottle to its maximum charges _(default: 10)_. If (and only if) your bottle has been destroyed, Refresh Spirit Bottle will create a new spirit bottle with its maximum number of charges.

Unlock Transform Abilities, Reclaim Spirit Bottle, and Refresh Spirit Bottle will be part of the standard library of rituals.

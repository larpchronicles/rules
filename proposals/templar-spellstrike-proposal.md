# Templar Spellstrikes Playtest
As a playtest, a player may choose at checkin to use these rules instead of the standard Templar rules and costs for spells. 

## Purpose
This document is a proposal to allow Templars to **only** spellstrike their spells.

### Goals
The aim here is to make Templar feel like a truly distinct class with its own with compelling gameplay mechanics and balance tradeoffs.

### The Current Problem 
Currently (v2.5.0), the Templar class is somewhat bland. It often feels like, "I'm a Mage, but with a sword," or "I'm a Fighter, but with a couple spells." Whether to build as a Templar is a question that effectively comes down to "As a Mage (or Fighter), is it cheaper to buy the skills I already have, but as a Templar?" The class does not provide much thematic value or compelling decisions to be made when building a character.

### Potential/Known Issues
It may take a couple events of adjustments to ability costs and such to balance these changes. Introducing what amounts to an entirely new class and PC game mechanics is a big change to the game, and so we must be understanding that it may be unbalanced until we dial it in.

## Abilities

### Spellstrike
This allows the caster to deliver a spell with a melee weapon physrep instead of a packet, by announcing `Spellstrike <Spell Incant>`. 

```EX: Spellstrike I grant you the gift of Death.```

It is as though the player used a packet; blocking the weapon physrep does not negate the spell (it is just like if a spell delivered via packet hits a player's shield).

**Templars would lose the capability of delivering spells via packets or touch-casting, and would _only_ be able to deliver spells via Spellstrike. This means that a Templar _must_ use a melee weapon to deliver a spell, even if they are casting it on themselves or a friendly target.**

### Impact on Other Abilities
The `Magic Delivery` skill (aka `Innate Casting`) will allow a Templar to omit the spell incant from the Spellstrike verbal:  
eg:```Spellstrike Death```
instead of ```Spellstrike I grant you the gift of Death.```

### Ability Costs
Overall, Spellstrikes represent a net increase in power level _vis a vis_ packet-delivered spells. While less versatile, the lack of utility is easily made up by the nearly guaranteed chance that the caster will not miss with the spell.

To balance this, Templars should pay a greatly increased Skill Point cost for Mana Points. Currently, the cost for the Primary Attunment skill for Templars is `6+1`. Under this proposal, that cost is increased to `8+2`.

This means that a Templar will have roughly half as many Mana Points under this playtest as they would have previously.


| Attunement Cost      | T   |  Prereqs      |
|:---------------------|:----:|:----------------:|
| Primary Attunement   | 8+2  | Relevant Mastery |
| Secondary Attunement | 16+4 | Relevant Mastery |
| Tertiary Attunement  | 24+6 | Relevant Mastery |


### Future Considerations
The costs Templars pay for Martial abilities will almost certainly also need to be adjusted, though it will be much more difficult to balance if both changes are made simultaneously. This may leave Templars somewhat over or underpowered for the initial event of playtesting this change.

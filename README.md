## Rule Doc Naming Convention

---
Filenames are prefixed with a number that is used to keep the ruleset in order and allow for easy insertion of new sections.
```
##_document-name.md
```
Example:
```
02-check-in.md
```

## Rule Doc Formatting Guidelines

---
```
# Rule Document

## Section Header

---
Content.

### Sub-Section Header
Content.
```
Example:
```
# Armor Rules

## Armor Strike Zones

---
These zones are valid.

### Illegal Strike Zones.
These zones are invalid.
```

## Rule Doc Table Formatting Guidelines

---
Current preference is to use markdown tables, rather than html tables.  When writing markdown tables, the IDE will likely try to correct the format to make it prettier to look at.  This has no effect on how it renders.

Example:
```
| TableHeader | TableHeader2 |TableHeader3|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Left-Aligned Content|Centered Content|Centered Content|
|Left-Aligned Content|Centered Content|Centered Content|
```
```
| TableHeader          |   TableHeader2   |   TableHeader3   |
|:---------------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| Left-Aligned Content | Centered Content | Centered Content |
| Left-Aligned Content | Centered Content | Centered Content |
```
Both formats will yield the table below:

| TableHeader          |   TableHeader2   |   TableHeader3   |
|:---------------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| Left-Aligned Content | Centered Content | Centered Content |
| Left-Aligned Content | Centered Content | Centered Content |

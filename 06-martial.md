#### Unarmed Combat

>This skill allows the character to use two Short Weapon length boffer weapons to represent claws or fists in order to fight in melee combat. The character may block with their Unarmed Combat weapons without taking damage normally.

#### Short Weapon

>The character may use a short one hand weapon between 24” long and less than 36” long in melee combat. Short one hand weapons include short sword, short axe, short hammer, and short club. This skill allows the use of the weapon in either hand, but not the ability to wield a short weapon in both hands at once.

#### Long Weapon 

>The character may use a long one hand weapon between 36” long and less than 48” long in melee combat. Long one hand weapons include long sword, rapier, battleaxe, warhammer, warmace, spear, and club. This skill allows the use of the weapon in either hand, but not the ability to wield a long weapon in both hands at once.

#### Two Hand Weapon

>The character may use a two hand weapon between 48” long and 72” long in melee combat. Two hand weapons include two hand swords, polearms, staves, and two hand clubs. Two hand weapons require both hands to be on the weapon in order to attack or block in melee combat. If the character blocks an attack with only one hand, the character will take the damage as if they had not blocked the attack at all.

#### Ranged Weapon

>This skill allows the character to use a ranged weapon in combat. Ranged weapons include bow, crossbow, and throwing weapons. Ranged weapons cannot be used to block attacks. If the character blocks an attack with a ranged weapon, the character will take the damage as if they had not blocked the attack at all.

#### Shield

>This skill allows the character to wield a shield used to block attacks. A shield may never be used for striking in combat. As long as the character has either hand on a shield, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the shield is considered effectively blocked.  The maximum surface area of a shield is 531 square inches. The longest dimension a shield may have is 36”.  Shields may not be used with two hand weapons, bows, or crossbows. A character may not dual wield shields.

#### Dual Short Weapon

#### Dual Long Weapon

>This skill allows the character to wield two long weapons, one in each hand, while in combat. Furthermore, a character with this skill may wield a long weapon in one hand and a short in the other, so long as they possess proficiency for both Long and Short weapons. This skill does not apply other skills or abilities to both weapon hands. <br/>Requires the Long Weapon skill.

#### Two Hand Block

>This skill allows the character to block with one hand using a two hand weapon without penalty.<br/>Requires the Two-Hand Weapon skill.

#### One Hand Short and Bow

>This skill allows the character to wield a short weapon in one hand, and a bow in the other using the bow only for blocking. Any blocked attack using the bow will require the character to complete a 3 second count to re-string the bow in order to use the weapon at range once again.<br/>Requires the Ranged and Short Weapon skills.

## Physical Strikes

Physical strikes are weapon delivered combat effects used by characters. A physical strike is delivered once using a weapon attack, and must strike the target character successfully without being blocked in order to be a successful attack. Physical strikes are considered used whether the attack was successful or not. Physical strikes that are blocked by shields or weapons, have been blocked and are considered unsuccessful attacks. Unsuccessful physical strikes and physical strikes that have been resisted can be regained by the character resting. Physical strike effects are not magical in nature; therefore, they cannot be removed by the Dispel Magic spell or any removal skill that is limited to effects of magical origin only.

## Spellstrike


Spellstrikes are spells cast upon a target via a physically represented weapon.  Packets do not count, as this would be touch casting.  Spellstrikes may not be refused in the way touch casts can.  Defenses for spells such as Spell Mirror, Intercept, and Parry Spell are effective against Spellstrikes.  The Parry skill will not block the spell of a Spellstrike.  If you physically parry a Spellstrike, you take the effect of the spell.

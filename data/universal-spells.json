Make sure that your light is only emitting a soft glow and not a sharp directed light as a game marshal may ask you to extinguish your light! The light is bound to the caster of the spell; should the caster be affected by a Dispel Magic spell or die, this spell will end immediately. A Glowing Light cannot be passed from one character to another."

This spell may be cast on a target up to 20 seconds after it dissipates. This spell only generates a Spirit Gem if the target does dissipate. The Caster should interact with the target if possible to collect their Spirit Gem. If this isn't possible, the Caster should Roleplay the moment as if cast normally, but must see Plot to collect their gems. A caster may only receive a single spirit gem from a target, regardless of how many Entrap Spirits are cast upon it."

The bonus damage from Backstab and One-Handed Weapon Proficiency may never be combined. A character cannot purchase both the One-handed Melee Proficiency skill and the Backstab skill. To use the damage from behind, the player must be physically behind the target and able to see both of the target's shoulder blades.<br><br>Example:<br>Reynold the Rogue purchases 10 Backstabs.

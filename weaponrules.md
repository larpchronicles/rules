# General Combat

* Combat is Light Touch only.  Violations of this are subject to the Card system.
    * Verbal Warning:  This is a first warning for hitting others too hard.
    * Yellow Card: Your character skills are reduced for one hour.
    * Red Card:  You will not be allowed to use weapons for the rest of the event.
* You must have a battle board on your person so that Plot can verify your per diem/usum abilities.
* If engaging with someone wearing an orange headband, you must follow the non-combatant rules and may only engage with them verbally.  See **<u>Headband Rules</u>** in the [Check In, Site Info, Cabins, & General Etiquette Doc].
* A packet can hit you anywhere and it counts (including clothing). Weapons that strike your head, groin, or a hand holding a weapon do not count.
* You may wear a shield that is not conjured, but if anything hits it, you take the damage.
* You can purposely use your hand to block a weapon if -- and only if -- that hand is holding a weapon.
* You may wear a Magic Shield that is not conjured, but if anything hits it, you take the damage.
* Your conjured weapons and shields go away after you successfully complete Rest.


## Weapon Reps

* All combat reps must be certified as safe. Safety checks for all combat reps may be performed at check-in.  Safety checks MUST be performed EVERY EVENT; they do not carry over from prior events.  A marshal may request to inspect your reps at any time during the event, and, if deemed unsafe, may lose their safety certification.
* Claws or Unarmed weapons must be made to normal weapon specs, including approved core materials and must have more than a 4” striking surface.
* Real archery reps are restricted.  Gameplay uses packet bow shooter designs.

## Bows and Crossbows

### Crossbows
The stock must be at least 12" long, and each limb must extend at least 6" from the stock (making the whole thing at least 12" wide).

If you wrap a string around the perimeter of the rep, the area it encloses must be at least 72 sq. in. (A 12" base, 12" height isosceles triangle).

If attached to your arm, you cannot use the bow while holding anything else in that hand, you cannot use the crossbow to block attacks, and you cannot attack with any melee weapons in either hand. If you want to be able to block with a shield, a weapon, or attack with a weapon, you must first remove the crossbow from your arm (or securely fold the limbs to the stock). If you are struck by any weapon, even if it does not strike the bow, you must spend at least 3 seconds roleplaying restringing the bow before you may fire it again.

The rep will be subject to a more rigorous safety inspection than a typical melee rep. It is **strongly** advised that you run your design idea past the staff before you begin construction; we would hate to see someone put a lot of time, effort, and resources into something that won't meet safety expectations.


**Crafting Materials**



* Ultralight Cores of carbon fiber, kitespar tube, fiberglass tube, or wrapped graphite tube.  Aluminum cores are only used for polearms.  Diameter should be between .414-.610”.
* Closed Cell Foam.  This can be pipe foam insulation and pool noodles and is used to pad the “blade” of a boffer.  It should have a wall at least ⅝” thick.
* Open Cell Foam.  Used for boffer tips, this is a less dense foam commonly found in fabric stores as fill for pillows or in hardware stores as pipe foam.
* Kite Tape or nylon rip stop repair tape.  Preferred vendor - [FunWithWind](https://funwithwind.com/store/ListCategoriesAndProducts2.asp?idCategory=186&idparent=171)
* [Dap Weldwood Contact Cement](https://www.amazon.com/00271-Weldwood-Original-Contact-Cement/dp/B0006MXRY8/ref=pd_di_sccai_2?pd_rd_w=gdI93&pf_rd_p=c9443270-b914-4430-a90b-72e3e7e784e0&pf_rd_r=NXDNHRFGZV673SHKBQWS&pd_rd_r=377eca45-f83c-4a21-a00f-3b4859ff9ab9&pd_rd_wg=MvJFD&pd_rd_i=B0006MXRY8&psc=1)
* [EVA Foam](https://www.foambymail.com/XPE2/cross-linked-polyethylene-foam-2lb.html)
* Duct tape or strapping tape.

**Weapon Crafters**

Some Chronicles players not only craft their own weapons, shields, and/or armor, but will assist or work with you to get pieces created for you.  Ask in #oog-trades-and-goods if you would like to try this route.


## Packets



* There are no type = color requirements.  However, there is a strong preference for white, as they are far easier to find.
* Wet, torn, or severely damaged packets should be discarded rather than returned to the NPC Camp packet bucket.
* A packet can hit you anywhere and it counts (including clothing). Weapons that strike your head, groin, or a hand holding a weapon do not count.
* When creating packets, an ideal cut size for the fabric is between 4”x4” to 6”x6”.
* The approximate amount of seed inside a packet is between 1/2 tbsp to 1 tbsp depending on the type of seed you use.  The resulting packet should not be so large that it cannot fit into a standard film canister (33 mm/ 1.3 inch).

### Crafting Materials

* **Fabric**- Cut or uncut white fabric that is a biodegradable natural fiber fabric. (Cotton, abaca, bamboo, lyocell, ramie, jute, hemp, silk.)  Please do not donate nylon, fleece, acrylic, polyester, or rayon fabrics for packets.
* **Rubber bands** - Size #32-33 is preferred (1/8"). Must be natural rubber.
* **Birdseed**- Millet bird seed or bird seed that does **not **contain sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.


## Shield Reps

* The longest dimension a shield may have is 36”.
* Everything attached to the shield and its edges (such as foam edging) counts as part of the shield.
* The maximum allowed surface area of a shield is 531 square inches and is calculated as if the shield were a flattened surface, counting any concavities into the silhouette.
* If a shield is curved or has three dimensions such as a partial cylinder or dome, that surface area is calculated into the total surface area.
* It is highly suggested that when making a shield rep, any fabric is detachable to prevent mold buildup.

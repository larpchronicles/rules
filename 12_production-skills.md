# Crafting

Item production is the process by which characters are able to craft consumable items within the game system. These items make up the backbone of the game economy and help support the various skills in the game. There are four crafting skills with each one being supported by a material harvesting skill.

## Material Harvesting Skills 

#### Foraging
>This skill is the prerequisite for the Alchemy Skill and is used to gather the materials for it. Foraging represents the character collecting herbs, making powders, and mixing base ingredients for use in Alchemy.

#### Mining
>This skill is the prerequisite for the Smithing Skill and is used to gather the materials for it.  Mining represents the character digging out raw ore, and collecting other sundry items for use with the Smithing skill.

#### Scrapping
>This skill is the prerequisite for the Tinkering Skill and is used to gather the materials for it.  Scrapping represents the character collecting scrap metals, bits of debris, and reclaiming materials from junk yards for use with the Tinkering skill.

#### Logging
>This skill is the prerequisite for the Rune Carving Skill and is used to gather the materials for it.  Logging represents the character collecting pieces of wood and shaping them into basic shapes for wands and rune marks.

## Raw Materials

>Production materials are ranked I-V. Characters with a gathering skill will be rewarded one rank of raw material for each rank of gathering skill that they possess, per day of the event. Characters using the gathering tools from Tinkering will receive an additional raw material rank for each skill rank in gathering that they possess. Additional raw materials can be bargained for  from NPCs, or other players. Characters can also search around in-game and gather raw materials from nodes in the game.

>Prior to an event starting, you can spend your raw material ranks, along with any raw material tags that you have, to craft in-game items. Once you are done crafting items before the game starts, logistics will give you tags for any unspent raw materials as well as tags for the items that you produced. <br/>When you get your raw material tags, you can request to get them in any rank I-X, as long as the total ranks are equal to the unspent ranks that you have left.

## Producing Items

>Production items are ranked from I-X. It takes as many raw materials ranks to make a single item equal to the production item’s rank. But wait! Production items are ranked I-X and raw materials are only ranked I-V, and then X; how do I get VI-IX raw materials? The answer to that is to combine the I-V raw materials to equal the rank of the production item that you are making.

>Examples:<br/>To make an Alchemy Rank I item, the character needs to have at least one rank in the Alchemy skill, and would use a single Rank I material. For Alchemy, this is Minor Alchemical Catalyst.<br/>To make a Smithing Rank 8 item, the character would need at least 8 Ranks in Smithing, and could use a combination of materials where the Ranks, when added up, equal the rank of the item desired. For Smithing this could be one Iron Ore (Rank V) and three Aluminum Ores (Rank I) added up equal enough ranks to make the item.

## Durability

>Any item that is non-consumable has a Durability rating. An item’s durability is reduced by one at the beginning of every event, and when an item’s Durability reaches 0, it is no longer usable, except for Recycling, see below. A player must check in all items they intend to use or have available to use at the beginning of an event. Any item that is not checked in and has it’s Durability marked down, is not legal for in-game use until it has been marked by Plot.<br/>Consumable items and Materials have an effective Durability of “Until Used”, and may not be Recycled.

## Recycling Items

>An item that has been reduced to 0 Durability, destroyed by a spell or skill, or an item that a player no longer wishes to use, may be Recycled by a player with the skill. An item that is Recycled will return 1/3rd of the ranks in materials used to construct it, rounded down. These materials can either be claimed for future use, or utilized immediately in the construction of a new item.

## Artificing

>Artificing is the study of the creation of magic items, and only those with at least a moderate command of each base material type can take their steps down the path of an Artificer. The creation of a magic item will vary wildly in it’s needs based on the item. Magic Items always require materials from multiple disciplines, as few as two, up to all four. They also require spirit gems for the infusion of their impressive powers. Lastly, more powerful items may require specific unusual or rare materials to be acquired in order to complete. All Artificers have access to a few base recipes that they may craft at will. Other items will require the development or acquisition of a Formula in order to be created. Formulas may also potentially be memorized, or even taught to others, depending on the Formula. Artificing requires 5 ranks in each production type.


## Workshops

>Characters can purchase a Workshop from Logistics for 10 Credits. Workshops have a durability of 10, and their durability is decreased each time they are used for an event by a given character. Workshops can be used to make large-scale batches of an item, doubling the total output for a single character. Ex: if you attempt to make 10 Heal Wounds potions, this would normally take you 30 Ranks in Alchemical materials. You could either spend 15 ranks, to make 5 potions which will get doubled by the Workshop, or spend the original 30 and get 20 potions instead.<br/>The Workshop must have a durability removed by Logistics during check-in in order to receive any batch production. More than one character may use a workshop for a given event, but each person who uses it will cost one durability.

### Weapon Coatings
Weapon coatings are single-use alchemical products that may be applied to weapons. To apply a coating, the user must have the coating in hand, and roleplay pouring or rubbing the coating on the weapon for 5 seconds. Only the character who had possession of the weapon when the coating was applied may use that coating.

For example, Alice applies a Sleep Coating to her long sword then hands the sword to Bob. Bob cannot use that coating.

## Artificing Products

>Artificing is a complex and daunting process that only the most dedicated of individuals dedicated to crafting can undertake. Only those with a decent grasp of all four crafting disciplines _(5 Ranks in each Skill)_ can walk the path of the Artificer, and it is this experience that will allow them to combine materials into effects that are greater than the sum of their parts, which many refer to as “Magic Items”. Artificers, like regular crafters, utilize recipes for their creations, though the recipe for a magic item is known as a Formula. All Artificers have access to a Standard Library of Formulas, which they may utilize at any time, given they have the appropriate materials to construct the desired item. Other items are known to exist, which are known as “Uncommon Formulas”, and Artificers may even attempt to invent their own, but these Formulas must first be created or discovered to utilize new and different items.

>A Magic Item will generally require the following for materials in order to be crafted. A number of materials of various kinds, with a total in material ranks equal to 10 times the Rank of the Magic Item, number of Spirit Gems equal to the Rank of the Item, and Items with Rank 5 and above will require unusual materials, sometimes multiple, that the Artificer or their companions will have to seek out in the greater world to infuse their creations with an extra spark of Magic. All Magic Items have a 10 Durability.

>Uncommon Formulas may sometimes be Memorized or even Taught by Artificers. Formulas discovered in the world will have a notation on them indicating if they can be Memorized, and if so, how many times before the Formula is no longer functional. They may also have a notation for how many times a Formula may be Taught after being Memorized, if it may be Memorized at all. If an Uncommon Formula is not capable of being Memorized, or the Artificer does not wish to Memorize it, then when attempting to create the item the Formula must be shown to Logistics before the item tag will be produced.

>Presented here are the Standard Library of Items, as well as any items known to the world at large as “Uncommon Formulas”, for which the Formula may be discovered or re-invented,

   >An item of fearsome power and renown, it earned its name for the often fatal after effects of those with the hubris to use this item without proper respect for the consequences. At will, the wearer of Mage’s Folly may Voice Radius deliver any spell they are capable of casting. However, upon doing so they are struck by a Non-Resistable, Incurable Silence effect, which is only removed after the wearer benefits from a full 2 Hour Rest. This item may not be used to deliver any Self only spells, any spells that only affect items (ex: Focused Destruction), or Circle of Power.<br/>

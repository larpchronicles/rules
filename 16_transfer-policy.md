# Transfer Policy

## Character Conversion from Other LARP Systems

---
* You may import your LARP character to Chronicles ONCE.  This is available to players from LARP Systems such as NERO or Alliance LARP.
* Importing your character does not invalidate your membership with other LARP organizations or your characters.
* Attending Chronicles events will have no impact on your character in other LARP Systems.
* After conversion, attending non-Chronicles LARP events will have no impact on your Chronicles character.
* All build points transfer to Chronicles as Skill Points.  If this number is below one hundred, you will start with one hundred Skill Points in Chronicles.
* Your former Transform does NOT carry over into Chronicles.

## Money, Gems & Items

---
* Coins, gems, and/or bank values from other LARP Systems do not transfer to Chronicles.
* Magic items and/or production items from other LARP Systems do not transfer to Chronicles.


## Goblin Points

---
Goblin Points from other LARP Systems do not transfer to Chronicles, but we do have our own Goblin Point reward system you can participate in.

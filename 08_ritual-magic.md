## About Ritual Magic

---
Ritual Magic is the way through which an individual attempts to weave the powers of themselves or greater beings to affect incredible and often long-lasting effects upon the world. A Ritualist is someone who is trained in these magics and in the art of channeling them to achieve their desired goals.

A Ritual is the act through which a Ritualist attempts to conduct these magics, and each Ritualist’s method for enacting a Ritual is different, though there are a few generally agreed upon elements that must be achieved in order for a Ritual to succeed. Firstly, a Ritual must last at least 5 minutes in order for success to be achieved. It has been said that in times of great need a Ritualist can attempt to end the Ritual earlier than this, but they risk Failure at best, horrible Backlash at worst. Secondly, a Ritual must contain a persistent visual or auditory element. Some Ritualists chant, sing, or recite scripture of their Deity. Others may choose to draw or cast Runes, dance, or create art as a focus for their magic. All that matters is that these elements are consistent throughout the Ritual, without long lapses or interruptions. Third, the Ritualist must provide a source of Power other than their own for the ritual, often in the form of Spirit Gems, a number of which must be provided equal to the Rank of the Ritual. Lastly, and most importantly, the Ritualist must have the Ritual Scroll open and accessible to them at all times during the Ritual, even if they do not need to actively gaze upon it. If the Ritual Scroll is not present, or if during the Ritual it is removed or hidden from the Ritualist, the Ritual will fail. These four elements are commonly referred to as the “Fundamental Four Elements” of Rituals, without which a Ritual is all but doomed to failure.

There are other ways through which a Ritualist may enhance their casting and thus the odds of success. A few of the more commonly accepted methods are as follows. First, the inclusion of further Ritual props, themed appropriately for the Ritual being attempted, though some Rituals may require specific props to be present to even be cast at all. Secondly, secondary Ritualists who can aid in the focusing and channeling of the magic, and even non-Ritualists whose nature or actions are particularly in-tune with the desired outcome of the Ritual may aid in its success. Some Ritualists opine that at their core, Rituals are a Performance for the Gods, and as such, the more devoted the casters are to providing a grand spectacle, the more likely the Gods are to look upon their attempts with favor and grant their desires. Conversely, if the participants in the Ritual are clearly out of sync, underprepared, or otherwise break the flow of the ritual, the Gods are more likely to punish the attempt.

There exists for Ritualists a “Standard Library” of Rituals, of which all Ritualists have access to at all times, as they are capable of producing a new scroll  for these Rituals from Memory. Rituals outside of this Library must be acquired through diligent research or through discovery in the world at large. Scrolls for Rituals outside the Standard Library may have the potential to be Memorized or even Taught, with each Scroll indicating how many times, if at all, it may be Memorized, and subsequently if it can be Taught and how often. Once Memorized, a Scroll is considered part of that Ritualist’s Standard Library. If a Ritual is not part of the Ritualist’s Standard Library, they must have the exact scroll to perform the Ritual, and this must be shown to Plot before Ritual can begin. If a Ritualist wishes to Memorize a Scroll, they must do so by showing the Scroll to Plot, so Plot can note their Character Sheet and the Scroll appropriately. For any Ritual in the Standard Library, a Ritualist must still have a Scroll representation during the Ritual, following all normal rules, they simply do not need the tagged Scroll item.

For Base Standard Library (not Memorized) Rituals, only the Fundamental Four Elements need to be achieved in order to guarantee success. For all others, it is recommended that further aspects be added, as with each increase in a Ritual’s level, the odds of success decrease. It is claimed that a Ritualist who attempts to cast a Ritual of exactly their Ranks in Ritual Magic using only the Fundamental Four Elements, they have at best a 60% chance of success. Higher Ranks in Ritual Magic, use of Props, secondary Casters, or other Participants can help increase these odds. Similarly, poor performance, inappropriate props or participants, or disjointed or disharmonic casting may decrease the odds of success, and invite potential Backlash.

A Ritual has 4 Possible Outcomes. First is Success. This indicates that the Ritual has succeeded as intended, and the desired effect has been achieved without further incident. Second is a Flaw. This means that the Ritual has completed, but often with a side-effect of some kind, with varying degrees of severity. Third is a Failure. This indicates that the Ritual failed, with no further effects, but any Spirit Gems or other consumable materials used in the Ritual are still consumed. Last, and most feared, is a Backlash. This indicates that the Ritual not only Failed, but a severe negative effect has occurred, up to and including Death of the Caster or Participants, and just as a Failure, any Spirit Gems or materials are still consumed.

Following are the Standard Library, and other Rituals for which the Scroll must be discovered or re-invented.

## Standard Library

---
### Rank I

#### Elemental Shift
>This ritual removes “Magic Missile” as an option for an arcane magic user at every level it is offered and replaces them with one of either:
> * Flame Bolt - “I conjure a flame bolt &lt;number>.”
> * Frost Bolt - “I conjure a frost bolt &lt;number>.”
> * Shock Bolt - “I conjure a shock bolt &lt;number>.”
> * Acid Bolt  -  “I conjure a stone bolt &lt;number>.”

>The target of this ritual chooses the element at the end of the ritual casting. This change is permanent until this ritual is once again cast on the target at which time a different element, or “Magic Missile” may be selected. 

>This ritual requires that the ritualist use a physical representation for each of the four elements: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. 

>Note: This spell does not affect the Rank I “Mana Bolt” spell.

#### Create Spirit Familiar
>This ritual siphons off a portion of the character's spirit, creating the physical form of a Spirit Familiar. The form of the Spirit Familiar is left up to the player with the final approval of the local Plot Team.

>Once the ritual is complete, the Spirit Familiar will take shape and be with the character at all times. The familiar is an in game spirit that only the character can communicate with, even though the Spirit Familiar is visible to everyone. The Spirit Familiar cannot be affected by physical or spell attacks of any kind, including weapon or packet delivered effects, nor can it be used as a shield to protect the character from them.

>The character may then procure further spirit rituals to begin a transformation process where the character casts a base “Spirit Transform to &lt;x>” ritual upon the Spirit Familiar, and subsequently casts empowerment rituals known as Transform Ability Rituals, based on the transformation of the Spirit Familiar. These empowering rituals allow the character to invest skill points on Transform skills.

>If at any time a character no longer wishes to pursue the path of their current Spirit Familiar, they may elect to have a new Spirit Familiar ritual cast upon them. However, this does not come without cost. The Spirit Familiar’s link to the character’s spirit is strong, and breaking it can be harmful. Upon casting a new Spirit Familiar, all previously unlocked Transform Abilities are lost, and the character permanently loses 50 SP. 

>This ritual requires that the target character have a pre-approved physical representation of their Spirit Familiar with them in the ritual.

### Rank II

#### Dampen Magic
>The caster attempts to extend their will to create an area that prevents the use of or casting of ritual magic - except for Destroy Ritual Magic.  If successful, the area will have a radius of 100ft that persists for 1 hour.  May only be destroyed by a Destroy Ritual Magic ritual.

### Rank III

#### Race Change
>The caster specifies a target to reshape its spirit of a race chosen by the caster. If the ritual succeeds the target is changed to the targeted race and gains the racial traits of the selected race, whilst losing those of the original. (Plot effects such as Awakened neck collars are preserved) A target may not be affected by a Race Change against its will.
#### Purify/Corrupt The Land
>The caster reaches out and taps into the primordial energy of the surrounding environment to either purify it of dark taint or call upon the fiends to spread their necrotic tendrils into the land. The size of surrounding land affected is 10x the caster’s ritual magic level.

### Rank IV

#### Spirit Lock
>This ritual forms a permanent bond between a specific item and a target individual This bond transcends the physical realm, ensuring that no matter where the individual may go, the item will always follow. As long as the item endures, it is Locked to the target, unable to be stolen, given away, or even used by another individual. If the target should die and their spirit departs to seek resurrection, the item will follow them. This does not grant any extra resilience for the item, and the effect will fade if the item is destroyed or expires.
#### Magical Barrier
>This ritual is designed to imbue the participants with additional magical shielding. Each target that actively participates in the casting of the ritual gains a single use of Resist Magic that lasts for one day or until used.

### Rank V

#### Spirit Forge
>The caster reaches into the very essence of the target and gives the target a glimpse into the infinite multitude of possibilities posed by their history and growth. This spell allows the target to instantly choose to change their chosen class, and/or re-assign all assigned Skill Points they possess.

### Rank VI

#### ?

### Rank VIII

#### Destroy Ritual Magic
>The caster attempts to focus their mastery of ritual magic in order to destroy any Ritual Magic effect. The difficulty of this spell is variable based on the level of the effect the caster is attempting to destroy. It is highly recommended that anyone undertaking this Ritual prepare thoroughly and do everything in their power to boost their chance of success, as any magic that might require such an intervention is likely to prove difficult to Destroy.

### Rank IX

##### ?

### Rank X

#### Empower Spirit
>The ritualist empowers a character with grand energies of might and magic. This ritual channels the energies of the consumed Spirit Gems directly into the target character, granting them incredible resilience to face an upcoming challenge. The target gains 2x Resist Physical and 2x Resist Spell, and an intangible suit of 50 Armor that cannot be refit by any means, but stacks over any worn armor and bypasses normal Armor Caps. These last until expended, the target resurrects, or 24 hours have passed. A character may be empowered in this way no more than once per week.

### Rank V

#### Spirit Familiar Transformation
This ritual is designed to empower and shape the powers of the target’s Spirit Familiar, which in turn will help guide the target down the Path of Power of the creature they wish to emulate. A Spirit Familiar Transformation scroll will have a specific type of creature listed for the Transformation. After the Ritual has been cast, the Target will be provided a list of available Transform Abilities that they can pursue the relevant Transform Ability Ritual Scrolls for, and once those have been cast, they will gain access to those as purchasable skills, until such time as their Spirit Familiar is replaced. A Spirit Familiar that has been subject to a Spirit Familiar Transformation cannot receive a different Transformation. If an individual wishes to change their chosen Creature, they must cast a new Spirit Familiar, losing all currently unlocked Transform Abilities, and incurring the usual SP loss for changing Spirit Familiars.

At casting, the player assigns an amount of skill points taken from the character, up to a maximum 50% of the character's total skill points. These skill points are deducted from the character's total skill points and placed into a skill point pool for the Spirit Familiar that may be used to purchase unlocked Transform Abilities.


The player may transfer more skill points from the character to the Spirit Familiar between events, but the Spirit Familiar may never have more than 50% of the character's total maximum skill points. The skill points allocated to the Spirit Familiar cannot be reclaimed by the character unless a new Spirit Familiar or Spirit Forge ritual is cast.


Upon the permanent death of the character, the Spirit Familiar will die, returning the stored Skill Points to the character, and bestowing the full transformation power to the character. The character will become an optional NPC available to the local Plot Team.

### Rank VI

#### Summon Entity
The caster attempts to call forth a being from beyond. The being, if summoned, can interact only with the caster for x min’s = the casters ritual magic level. The being can be that of a spirit that has been long deceased, a creature of the dark nether, or some other extraplanar entity known to the caster.

### Rank VII

#### Spirit Bottle
The caster places the majority of their spirit within the confines of a specially prepared Crystal Bottle. This process helps protect the spirit from the strain of leaving their mortal coil. The next time the Caster reaches 0 body within 24 hours, their body immediately crumbles and their spirit returns to the Spirit Bottle to regenerate a body with no increase in Strain. If the Bottle has been destroyed at the time they attempt to regenerate, the spirit must seek resurrection as normal, including accruing Strain.

### Rank VIII

#### Improve Aether Flow
The ritualist creates an area of improved Aether flow that will enhance the speed of Rest. This area must be a clearly defined 10 foot radius circle. The border of the area provides no protection or other benefits other than aiding Rest. 

The Resting area will last for 5 days. Within the area, for each 15 minutes of time that a character Rests within the area, their maximum Rest time will be reduced by 30 minutes. Rest time cannot be reduced to below 30 minutes. 
      
This ritual requires that the ritualist provide a relaxing environment for the characters that are resting.

### Rank IX

#### ?

### Rank X

#### Transformation to &lt;Creature>
A ritual that grants the target the imbuement of a powerful spirit that remains dormant most of their lives. Only in times of great danger or crisis will this spirit emerge and grant it’s host strength to try and persevere.

A Scroll of Transformation to &lt;Creature> will have a specific creature type listed, and may not be used for any other Creature type. These scrolls can never be Memorized or Taught. Once cast, this Ritual is Permanent unless subject to a Destroy Ritual Magic

This ritual requires either at least a single Spirit Gem filled with a fragment of the creature the target wishes to embody, or the blessing and participation of a creature of the indicated type. 

The effects of Transformation are entirely at Plot discretion, upon receiving a Transformation you will be given a Stat Card for what effects and abilities you will receive should the Transform ever activate. These Transformations are often more powerful than a Spirit Familiar, but due to their infrequent activation, they are often less sought after. 

This ritual acts in opposition to a Spirit Familiar, and someone who has a Spirit Familiar may not have a Transformation, and vice-versa.

Upon the permanent death of the character, if the character has a Transformation effect on their spirit, they will rise as an optional NPC available to the local Plot Team with the full transformation power of the character.

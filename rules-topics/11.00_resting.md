# Resting

## Resetting Skills and Magic Items

---
Adventurers are powerful individuals who rely on magic and skill to defeat their enemies. This expenditure of endurance both physically and magically takes a toll on even the most mighty of heroes on Evren. Even the most powerful of artifacts requires time to recharge its stores. 

There are two ways skills and magic items can be recharged and used again:  Rest or Per Day.

## Rest

---
Rest is a short period of time that the character takes to relax and recharge the energy required to use their skills and abilities.  Resting requires that the character take a break from adventuring for a period of time.  This break is represented by ten minutes of Concentration spent in town.  Concentration requires the character to be silent, not use any in game items, abilities, or skills, and to not move faster than a walk.  If the character does any of these things or receives damage, their Concentration is broken and there Rest ended unsuccessfully.

Resting can be stopped by the character at any time. If the character's body is damaged, or if the character suffers death, the Rest will also be stopped. Once the Rest is stopped, the character must restart the Rest from the beginning. 

Once the Rest is complete, the character will have all their skills and abilities returned to them for another use. Any effects that have a duration of Rest also become expired on the character. 


## Per Day

---
Magic items, production skills, and some effects recharge or expire at the end of the day. This time occurs at 6pm (out of game) each day. This happens automatically and is not considered a Rest period.

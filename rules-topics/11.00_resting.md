# Resting

## Resetting Skills and Magic Items

---
Adventurers are powerful individuals who rely on magic and skill to defeat their enemies. This expenditure of endurance both physically and magically takes a toll on even the most mighty of heroes on Evren. Even the most powerful of artifacts requires time to recharge its stores. 

There are two ways skills and magic items can be recharged and used again:  Rest or Per Day.

## Rest
Rest is a short period of time to recuperate and regain expended skills and abilities. Upon the completion of a Rest, a character's ability pools will be reset to full, and any per-Rest abilities are renewed and able to be used again.

Resting takes 10 minutes. Using any game skills, running, losing health, dying, or otherwise engaging in strenuous activity will interrupt the Rest, and require it to be restarted. A character may not initiate a Rest within two hours of the completion of a previous Rest. A player may also choose to NPC during their character's Rest Time for more game rewards!
 
The player must record the time of their Rest on their battleboard or character sheet, and must inform a Logistics Marshal as soon as is convenient.

## Per Day

---
Magic items, production skills, and some effects recharge or expire at the end of the day. This time occurs at 6pm (out of game) each day. This happens automatically and is not considered a Rest period.

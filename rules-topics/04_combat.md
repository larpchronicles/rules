# Combat Rules

## Appropriate Strike Zones

---
	Pending.

## Armor: Immunities

---
In the event that the player are hit by an ability that they are immune to, their armor does not take the damage.

## Armor: Receiving Damage

---
During combat, when damage is taken by a character, it is first deducted from the Armor Point total, unless otherwise stated by a specific spell or skill. If the player still has Armor Points remaining, it does not matter which location is covered by armor, they will still deduct the damage from their remaining points.

## Bows: Blocking

---
Bows may be used to block attacks.  Bows may also be used to block attacks while wielding a One-Handed Weapon the skills One-Handed Weapons, Ranged Weapons, and Dual Wield are purchased.  If used to block an attack, the player must spend a 3 second count to restring the bow before they can use it again.  

## Casting Spells

---
Casting a spell is an act of will and physical effort combined, gathering the energy that the caster has prepared in their memory and then throwing it out into the world. In LARP Chronicles, a spell’s energy is represented by a "spell packet", a small bundle of cloth, usually filled with bird seed, that is thrown at, or touched against other participants, in order to use magic.

When casting a spell, first a player must have a spell packet in a free hand. Then, they cast the spell by stating the incant, each spell having its own unique incant, and then either touching the packet to the intended target, or throwing it. If the spell packet strikes a target successfully, they are affected as per the spell’s description, unless they are capable of resisting the magic. 

A "Free Hand" in this instance means that the hand holding the spell packet may not be holding any other in-game or tagged items. I.E., no swords, shields, potions, and such. A player may hold multiple spell packets in the same hand and still cast, as they are not considered in-game items.

One must be careful when casting spells, because if an enemy is within reach, or they have a ranged weapon, they risk their spell being disrupted mid-cast if they manage to strike them with a weapon blow, or if they take damage from any source during the incant. If their spell is disrupted, it is lost and they must complete a rest to recover it.

If a player fails to correctly incant the spell, do not worry, though the spell doesn't work, they do not consume any mana, and must simply start the spell over.

Some spells require a "X count" to cast where X may be three or five.  This is always intended to be X number of seconds.

## Charging

---
Charging refers to a player's proximity to another player in melee combat.  In combat, combatants should never be inside the physical reach another combatant.  Combatants should not be able to make skin to skin contact.
* Charging unfairly prevents one combatant from attacking their combat partner.
* Charging can prevent a combatant from being able to attack safely and can result in players being struck in illegal strike zones or injuries to areas such as the eyes.
* Charging forces one combatant to backpedal or retreat.  We often play on uneven ground and this could result in a player tripping and sustaining injuries.

## Damage Calls, Types, Flavors, & Carriers

---
Casting Damage calls are how a player can communicate the amount of damage being delivered, as well as its type and whether or not it has a flavor modifier or carrier.  A player may only use one value for each option.

**Damage Call Structure** 
```
# <Type> [Flavor/Carrier(optional)]
```

Examples:
* 5 Normal
* 2 Magic Flame
* 23 Silver Death

Suppose Zee has a normal longsword, a transform with the Magic Aura and Flame Aura abilities, and a Frost coating applied to the weapon. Zee would swing one of:
* 5 Magic
* 5 Normal
* 5 Magic Flame
* 5 Normal Flame
* 5 Magic Frost
* 5 Normal Frost

| Damage Types | Damage Flavors | Damage Carriers |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Magic        | Flame          | Curse           |
| Normal       | Frost          | Death           |
| Poison       | Shock          | Drain           |
| Silver       | Stone          | Vital           |

Unless explicitly stated, a player is always able to drop their carrier. They may have many carriers, but they must always choose to swing one or fewer.
>Example: Bob the Lich has Monstrous Carrier: Drain and Monstrous Carrier: Death. Bob can choose to swing 5 Magic, OR 5 Magic Drain, OR 5 Magic Death. Bob cannot swing 5 Magic Death Drain.
> 
This is not necessarily true with auras (ie, damage types). So, if a player has a sword with Magic Aura, they cannot choose to swing Normal or Silver with it.
  EXCEPT if they have another effect, such as Monstrous Silver Aura, they may then choose to swing Silver regardless of weapon. Examples include:
  >Alice the Adventurer has a silvered long sword. She may only swing 5 Silver with it. If she wishes to swing 5 Normal, she must use a different weapon.
  
  >Gary the Golem has the transform ability Monstrous Silver Aura. While wielding a normal Long Sword, he may choose to swing 5 Normal OR 5 Silver.
  
  >Barrack the Brood has the ability Monstrous Poison Aura and a Magic Long Sword. He may only choose to swing 5 Poison OR 5 Magic with that sword.
  
  >Archibald the Artificer has a silvered short sword. He decides to use his artificing skill to enchant the sword with a Magic Aura. The resulting weapon is no longer silvered, and will only have Magic Aura on the item tag.

Abilities that cause damage (Such as Mana Bolt, Doom, etc.) can never function as Damage Carriers.
## Defensive Ability Slots

---
Using any skill, ability, or effect that grants a Resist, Reflect, or Dodge requires a Defense Slot to be prepared.  All characters have one Defense Slot by default and may purchase additional slots with Skill Points.  Each Defense Slot a character may prepare and consider active.  A character may only have as many Active Defenses as they have Defense Slots.  Once prepared, any Active Defense may be used to defend against the appropriate type of attack, allowing them to call Resist, Reflect, or Dodge respectively.

### Healed By [Effect]

---
When you have an ability or active effect that makes you take Healed By an effect (For
example, Shock, Stone, Flame, or Frost).  Creatures with this ability cannot be healed by weapon attacks (except Spellstrikes), but can be healed by packet attacks. 

Examples:  
You are healed by Frost.
* If you are hit with a spell "I conjure a Frost Bolt 10." Or "Spellstrike I conjure a Frost Bolt 10" you would say “Got it, appears to heal me” and restore up to 10 body (if you are below your maximum body).
* If you are hit with an "Aether Frost Bolt 10" you would call “Got it, appears to heal me”.
* If you are hit with a sword and someone says “10 Magic Frost” the call would be “Got it” and you would take the damage as normally.

## Headbands:  Non-Combatants & Pages

---
People wearing orange headbands are referred to as Pages.  Pages are people that are unable to enter combat.  They may be children or adults, although any child under age 14 must be a Page.

**A player may not ever physically strike a Page.**  Pages may not use combat skills, weapons, or throw packets.  If they engage in combat with a page, they may point their weapon or packet and say, "Page, I kill you."  They are treated as if they have 1 body.

### Immunities

---
When you have an inherent ability or active effect that makes you explicitly immune to an effect you call "No Effect" if you are hit by a spell or weapon carrier using that effect.  If you are immune to part of the weapon damage call then you are immune to all of it.  The exception to this would Stasis or other abilities that explicitly state the things to which you become immune (and that call should always be, "No effect; Visibly in Stasis").

Examples:
* If you have Immune to Toxin, and you are hit by a Sleep dart, you would call "No Effect".
* If you are Immune to Curse and got hit with a weapon swinging 10 Magic Curse, you would call "No Effect".
* If you are Immune to Shock and got hit with an "Aether Shock Bolt 10" you would call "No Effect".
* If you are not immune to Stun, and you get hit by a Stun spell, you would call "Got it". If you are then hit by another Stun effect, you would call "Got it" again.
* If you are a PC with no non-standard effects, are not dead, and get hit by a Create Undead, you would call "Got it".
* If you do not have Immune to Life on your stat card, are alive, and get hit by a Life spell, you would call "Got it".
* If you are dead and get hit by a Death spell, you call "Got it".
* If you are Dead, and you get hit by a Heal Wounds, Confine, etc., you would call "Got it"

## Killing Blows

---
Killing Blow is a 3-count that can be interrupted. When Killing Blowed, the target becomes Dead. Killing Blow 1, Killing Blow 2, Killing Blow 3 <type>.

The target of a killing blow may refuse it, so long as they are capable of movement.  Any killing blow is assumed to automatically be refused by a target capable of movement, unless explicitly accepted by the target.

## Light Touch

---
    Pending.

## Magic Deliverance, Voice Radius, and Aether

---
Rarely, one may encounter entities that are capable of delivering magic quicker than normal, skipping the incantation and abridging it to simply Magic followed by the spell name, for example, Magic Fear. This is still an effective spell, and needs to be reacted to as such.

Similarly, some entities may deliver a spell via "Voice Radius," at which time anyone who can hear the declared spell, whether enemy or ally, is subject to it as if they’d been struck by the spell directly. This ability does not require the caster to have a Spell Packet in hand.

Finally, powerful creatures can sometimes deliver a spell as an Aether spell. If a player is struck by an Aether spell, no resistances can prevent the effect, and they are affected by it immediately.

## Shields

---
The maximum surface area of a shield is 531 square inches. The longest dimension a shield may have is 36".

As long as the character has either hand on a shield, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the shield is considered effectively blocked.

Limitations:
* A shield may never be used for striking in combat. 
* Shields may not be used with two-handed weapons, bows, or crossbows.
* A character may not dual wield shields.
* Shields are not capable of blocking spell packets or toxins without the use of an ability.

## Speed of Combat

---
    Pending.

## Spell Packets

---
Anything in a player's possession being struck by a spell causes them to take the effect of the spell, even if it is an illegal strike zone.  If illegal strike zones are being targeted repeatedly, inform Plot or a member of Staff immediately.


### Spellstrikes

---
Spellstrikes are spells cast upon a target via a physically represented weapon.  Spellstrikes may not be refused in the way touch casts can.  Defenses for spells such as Spell Mirror, Intercept, and Parry Spell are effective against Spellstrikes.  The Parry skill will not block the spell of a Spellstrike.  If a player physically parries a Spellstrike, they take the effect of the spell. An individual capable of using Spellstrike may treat a wielded weapon as a spell packet for the purposes of touch-casting. Packets may not be used to Spellstrike.
	
### Touch-Casting

---
If a player is touching the target directly with a spell packet, the target has the ability to "refuse your touch-cast", causing the player to expend the magic to no effect.  Any spell may be touch-cast. The target of a touch-cast spell may refuse the touch-cast, so long as they are capable of movement. Any and every offensive or negative touch-cast spell is assumed to automatically be refused unless explicitly accepted by the target.


### Turtling

    Pending.

## Weapons Safety Check

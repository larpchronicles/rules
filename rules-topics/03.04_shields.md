# Shields

---
## Shield Construction
* A shield cannot be longer than 36" in any dimension (including diagonally), shorter than 12" in any direction, and must encompass an area less than 720 sq.in. 
* Everything that is part of the shield counts as the shield.
* The surface area of the shield is calculated as if the shield were a flattened surface, and counts concavities in the shield's silhouette.
  * If the shield is curved or the face of the shield has three dimensions (ex: A partial cylinder, a dome shield, etc.), then the area is calculated including that space.
  * If you cover the face of your shield with tape, then the area of the shield would be (at minimum) equal to the area of tape.
  * If you took a string and wrapped it around the shield edge, the shape enclosed by that string is (at minimum) the area of the shield.


## Shield Crafting Materials
* Closed Cell Foam.  This can be pipe foam insulation and pool noodles and is sometimes used to pad edges.

# Shields

---
A shield cannot be longer than 36" in any dimension (including diagonally), shorter then 12" in any direction, and must encompass an area less than 531 sq. in. (So, a perfectly circular shield could have a diameter of 26in). Everything that is part of the shield counts as the shield. The surface area of the shield is calculated as if the shield were a flattened surface, and counts concavities in the shield's silhouette. If the shield is curved or the face of the shield has three dimensions (ex: A partial cylinder, a dome shield, etc.), then the area is calculated including that space. If you cover the face of your shield with tape, then the area of the shield would be (at minimum) equal to the area of tape. If you took a string and wrapped it around the shield edge, the shape enclosed by that string is (at minimum) the area of the shield.

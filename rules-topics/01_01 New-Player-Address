# Hello (potentially) New Player!
---
Chronicles is your story waiting to happen. You share it with many other players, but you are no less important! We aim to foster a safe place to act out these stories, and share experiences of heroes and villains, as well as triumphs and losses. 

We’d love for you to get involved at a speed you are comfortable with. Many ways to do this are possible:
Attending and hanging out before a game to meet people and ask questions.
Try playing an NPC (Non-player Character, monster) for a weekend and using different aspects of the game.  Playing a non-player character is a great opportunity to start getting a grasp of the rules, and trying different abilities while you have STAFF watching to make sure you do everything right.
Play a pre-built character.
Dive in and make a character of your own.
We hope you reach out soon, make a character, and become a familiar face to the Market Faire of Varos. Follow this link to check out our “Getting Started” section to start learning.

Character Creation:
---
Have an idea of who you were before the market fare: Adventurers are typically not born full-sized and equipped. The following questions are questions to help you understand your character, so you can better demonstrate them to fellow players and staff. By no means are these required to be answered.

What did you do to make a living? 
Where did you live? 
How do/did you live? (Quality, professions, etc)
Where did you learn to use weapons/magic?
Who were/are your parents?
Do you have siblings?
Who likes you? Who doesn’t like you?
Do you have any special rules you keep for yourself?
Do you have goals or personal quests?
When did the adventuring life take hold?
Do you have any outstanding debts?
Did you have preconceived notions of other adventurers?
Who or what is important to you?

Mechanically building a character:
* Pick a name: People are going to have to call you something, and we need to keep track of you in our character database.
* Pick a Race: Your heritage dictates some extra abilities you get, and is a key element to the presentation of your character.
* Order your Specializations: There are several pools that are used in a majority of our games. Prioritization determines the cost of the things inside of that pool. Even if you don’t intend to be involved in combat it may behoove you in the future to have these picked out. Loosely you can look at them this way:
Stamina focuses on buying weapon proficiencies and skills to do damage.
Agility focuses on buying utility skills that influence combat through means other than damage.
Magic focuses on buying the schools of magic, and mana to use the spells in those schools.
* Purchase applicable skills using skill points: This is how you fine-tune your character and the feats they’re capable of.

We also have a calculator to help make this easier!

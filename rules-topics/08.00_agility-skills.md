# Agility Skills

## Agility Points
> Agility Points are purchased with Skill Points and may then be used to toward uses of Agility Pool Abilities.  Each purchase of Agility Points grants 10 Agility Points. Using an ability will remove a number of Agility Points from their pool equal to the ability's level. 
> 
> Characters may alternatively choose to explicitly memorize their ability list. Doing so grants a bonus 10% total Agility Points to be distributed. The character must mark down how many of which abilities they have chosen to memorize, and they may then only use those abilities (until their next Rest).

|Agility Pool|F|T|R|M|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cost Per 10 Agility|10+10|20+10|5+5|20+10|


## Mimicry
> This skill allows the user to use any single Spell or Stamina ability once per purchase of Mimicry.  The user must additionally expend a number of Agility Points equal to double the mimicked ability's Mana or Stamina cost, as appropriate.  Mimicry cannot be used on level 10 Spells.  Use requires the verbal:  My turn!  <ability verbal/incant>

|Mimicry Point Costs|F|T|R|M|

|Mimicry|5+10|20+10|3+5|20+10|

## Transform Abilities

### Unlocking Transform Abilities
Before a character may purchase a monstrous ability on their transform, that ability must be "unlocked". Some abilities are unlocked by default (per transform). 

Unlocking an ability requires consuming a number of Spirit Gems dependent on the level of the ability:
Basic - 1 Spirit Gem
Advanced - 2 Spirit Gems
Expert - 3 Spirit Gems
Master - 4 Spirit Gems
Grandmaster - 5 Spirit Gems

Mythical Abilities, and any ability that specifies a specific component required to unlock, will require casting the Unlock Transform Abilities ritual.

Unlock Transform Abilities is part of the standard ritual library and thus always available to any character that has at least 1 rank of Ritual Magic.

Alternatively, a character may still perform the Unlock Transform Abilities ritual. Doing so reduces the Spirit Gem cost of each ability unlocked by 1 (0 for Basic, 5 for Grandmaster).

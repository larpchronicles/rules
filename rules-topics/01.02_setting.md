# Game Setting

---
Chronicles is a sword & sorcery fantasy game set in a pre-industrial world called Evren.  Our chapter primarily centers around the port town of Varos within the Kingdom of the Terran Valley.  Adventurers from all over this world meet in Varos for the market fairs.

In Evren, adventurers may be regarded as <i>different</i> from the normal folk in the world.  

A weekend event is referred to as a market fair and these are nearly always held in Varos, but Evren has plenty of other locations to visit, ~explode~ explore, form alliances, build towns, make enemies, and more.  A longer, player-maintained glossary of in world places and people can be found in the glossary of the rulebook.

## Game Atmosphere
Chronicles science, medicine, and technology is roughly equivalent to 14th century Earth.  For roleplay, players are encouraged to act, speak, and behave as if they exist in that time frame.  We do of course allow players to use modern medicine but if possible, it should be done away from a large crowd to promote the in game atmosphere.

### Religion
There are beings known as archons in Chronicles, but how a character views or engages with them is up to the individual player.  No character is required to worship an archon.

We strive to be inclusive and respectful at Chronicles and do not want anyone to be in the situation of giving offense to others.  The use of any real world religious symbols or iconography in the game, including costuming, garb, or props, is explicitly disallowed.  Similarly, in roleplay, it is unacceptable to use invocations of gods, demons, mythical creatures, legends, or other recognizable figures of real world religious, spiritual, or mythological importance.

### Politics
In game politics are part of life. Whether a character wishes to serve the king loyally, ignore his command, or attempt a rebellion is up to them!  Just know that there may be in-game consequences for a character's actions.  OOG political symbols, slogans, and iconography are explicitly disallowed.

### Necromancy
Evren as a whole does not view necromancy as an inherently evil or bad thing, though most people find it at least distasteful. There are laws against it in nearly all kingdoms, and for those where it isn't, there are guilds that regulate and oversee its use.

# Crafting

Item production is the process by which characters are able to craft consumable items within the game system. These items make up the backbone of the game economy and help support the various skills in the game. There are three material harvesting skills ([Foraging](#foraging-products), [Logging](#logging-products), and [Mining](#mining-products)) and four crafting skills ([Alchemy](#alchemy-products), [Rune Carving](#rune-carving-products), [Smithing](#smithing-products),  and [Artificing](#artificing-products)).

## Material Harvesting Skills 

#### Foraging
>This skill is the is used to gather the materials for the Alchemy Skill. Foraging represents the character collecting herbs, making powders, and mixing base ingredients for use in Alchemy.

#### Logging
>This skill is the is used to gather the materials for the Rune Carving Skill. Logging represents the character collecting pieces of wood and shaping them into basic shapes for wands and rune marks.

#### Mining
>This skill is the is used to gather the materials for the Smithing Skill. Mining represents the character digging out raw ore, and collecting other sundry items for use with the Smithing skill.


## Raw Materials
>Production materials are ranked I-V, and X. Characters with a gathering skill will be rewarded two ranks of raw material for each rank of gathering skill that they possess, per day of the event. Additional raw materials can be bargained for  from NPCs, or other players. Characters will also rarely get the opportunity to gather additional materials during mods.
> 
> Ex: Verse has 7 ranks in Logging, and 2 ranks in Mining. He is attending a 2 Day event. He will receive 28 Ranks of Logging Materials (7 x 2 Ranks, 14 Ranks Per Day, for 2 days.) and 8 Ranks of Mining Materials (2 x 2 Ranks, 4 Ranks Per Day, for 2 Days).
>
>Prior to an event starting, you can spend your raw material ranks, along with any raw material tags that you have, to craft in-game items. Once you are done crafting items before the game starts, logistics will give you tags for any unspent raw materials as well as tags for the items that you produced. When you get your raw material tags, you can request to get them in any rank I-X, as long as the total ranks are equal to the unspent ranks that you have left.

## Producing Items
>Production items are ranked from I-X. It takes as many raw materials ranks to make a single item equal to the production item's tier. But wait! Production items are ranked I-X and raw materials are only ranked I-V, and then X; how do I get VI-IX raw materials? The answer to that is to combine the I-V raw materials to equal the tier of the production item that you are making.
>
>Examples:
> 
>To make an Alchemy Tier I item, the character needs to have at least one rank in the Alchemy skill, and would use a single Rank I material. For Alchemy, this is Minor Alchemical Catalyst.
> 
> To make a Smithing Rank 8 item, the character would need at least 8 Ranks in Smithing, and could use a combination of materials where the Ranks, when added up, equal the rank of the item desired. For Smithing this could be one Iron Ore (Rank V) and three Aluminum Ores (Rank I) added up equal enough ranks to make the item.

## Durability
>Any item that is non-consumable has a Durability rating. An item's durability is reduced by one at the beginning of every event, and when an item's Durability reaches 0, it is no longer usable, except for Recycling, see below. A player must check in all items they intend to use or have available to use at the beginning of an event. Any item that is not checked in and has its Durability marked down, is not legal for in-game use until it has been marked by Plot. Consumable items and Materials have an effective Durability of "Until Used", and may not be Recycled.

## Recycling Items
>An item that has been reduced to 0 Durability, destroyed by a spell or skill, or an item that a player no longer wishes to use, may be Recycled by a player with the skill. Items that are in use or activated, such as locks, may not be Recycled.  An item that is Recycled will return 1/3rd of the ranks in materials used to construct it, rounded down to a minimum of one. These materials can either be claimed for future use, or utilized immediately in the construction of a new item. This may _not_ be used on Consumed items.

## Artificing
>Artificing is the study of the creation of magic items. Only those with at least a moderate command of each base craft can take the path of an Artificer. The creation of a magic item will vary wildly in its needs based on the item. Magic items always require materials from multiple disciplines. They also require spirit gems for the infusion of their impressive powers. All Artificers have access to a few base recipes that they may craft at will. Other items will require the development or acquisition of a Formula in order to be created. Formulas may also potentially be memorized, or even taught to others, depending on the Formula. Artificing requires 5 ranks in each production type.

## Weapon Auras
>By default, a base weapon will use Normal as its **Damage Type**.
> 
>A weapon that has been silvered may only use Silver as its **Damage Type** (ie: it can no longer swing for Normal).
>
> A weapon that has been enchanted with a Magic Aura may only swing Magic as its **Damage Type**, and cannot be silvered. If a weapon is silvered then enchanted, it also becomes a magic sword and may only swing Magic (ie, a weapon with a Magic Aura must always use Magic **Damage Type**†)
>
>A weapon may have only a single flavor or carrier enchantment (ie: a weapon cannot have both Flame Aura and Shock Aura).
>
>TL;DR: A weapon can only swing for Normal, Silver, Magic or Poison **Damage Type**, and can only be changed by a craftsman. Additionally, a weapon may also have up to one flavor/carrier aura, which is optional in the damage call.

|Enchantments|Damage Type|Flavor/Carrier|Attack Calls|
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
|None|Normal|None|1 Normal|
|Flame Aura|Normal|Flame|1 Normal, 1 Normal Flame|
|Silvered|Silver|None|1 Silver|
|Silvered, Shock Aura|Silver|Shock|1 Silver, 1 Silver Shock|
|Magic Aura|Magic|None|1 Magic|
|Magic Aura, Stone Aura|Magic|Stone|1 Magic, 1 Magic Stone|
> 
>† _Weapon Coatings and Monstrous Auras can still be used with a weapon that has a Magic Aura._

### Toxins 
| Effect          | Ingestible Tier | Coating Tier | Dart/Trap Tier |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Blind Toxin    | 1               | 2            | 3              |
| Slow Toxin     | 1               | 2            | 3              |
| Weakness Toxin | 3               | 4            | 5              |
| Kneel Toxin    | 4               | 5            | 6              |
| Silence Toxin  | 5               | 6            | 7              |
| Sleep Toxin    | 6               | 7            | 8              |
| Curse Toxin    | 7               | 8            | 9              |
| Stun Toxin     | 8               | 9            | 10             |

>Alchemy is capable of creating a variety of Ingestible Toxins. Each type in turn is capable of being turned into a Weapon Coating, a Dart for Throwing, or a Trap. Above is an easy reference table to show the tier at which a specific Toxin can be made in each of its forms. As a rule of thumb, the base Tier of an item +1 is a Coating, +2 for a Dart or Trap.

### Weapon Coatings
>Weapon coatings are single-use alchemical products that may be applied to weapons. To apply a coating, the user must have the coating in hand and roleplay pouring or rubbing the coating on the weapon for a 5-second count. Only the character who had possession of the weapon when the coating was applied may use that coating.
>
>For example, Alice applies a Sleep Coating to her long sword then hands the sword to Bob. Bob cannot use that coating.
>
>However, if Charlie presents his sword to Diane, who then applies a Sleep Coating to Charlie's sword, then Charlie (and only Charlie) may use that Sleep Coating.
>
>Once applied, the coating will last until it is used or the wielder rests, whichever comes first.
> 
### Toxin Darts
> Toxin Darts function similarly to their Ingestible Counterparts, except they have been processed into an aerosolized gas instead of a powder that must be consumed to take effect. When using a Toxin Dart, the user must throw a packet while declaring "Toxin (Effect)" of the type indicated on the item tag. This cannot be blocked by weapons or shields, much like a Spell Packet.
> 
### Traps
> Traps are pre-placed objects designed to deliver an effect to a small area when their trigger is set off. Trap Reps must be a minimum of 12"x6"x6", to a maximum of 36" in any dimension, and all Trap designs must be approved by a Rules Marshal prior to use. 
> 
> Setting a trap requires a minimum of 1 minute, but the trap is not active until the trigger has been fully set.
> 
> All traps must have a real, physical trigger that is attached to the trap. Setting off the trap must produce a noise or light that is detectable by an impartial observer. It must always be possible to see how to disarm a trap, although it may require light and a small mirror. 

## Workshops
>Characters can purchase a Workshop from Logistics for 10 Credits. Workshops have a durability of 10, and their durability is decreased each time they are used for an event by a given character. Workshops can be used to make large-scale batches of an item, doubling the total output for a single character.
>  
>Example: If you attempt to make 10 Heal Wounds potions, this would normally take you 30 Ranks in Alchemical materials. You could either spend 15 ranks, to make 5 potions which will get doubled by the Workshop, or spend the original 30 and get 20 potions instead.  The Workshop must have a durability removed by Logistics during check-in in order to receive any batch production. More than one character may use a workshop for a given event, but each person who uses it will cost one durability.
> 
> Workshops cannot be used to duplicate Artificing items.

#### Elixir of Invulnerability
> This incredible feat of Alchemical creation, this golden elixir represents the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Upon imbibing, which takes a three count, the drinker is made INVULNERABLE for 20 seconds. However, the overwhelming power of the elixir renders them incapable of doing much else.

## Artificing Products

>Artificing is a complex and daunting process that only the most dedicated of individuals dedicated to crafting can undertake. Only those with a decent grasp of all three crafting disciplines _(5 Ranks in each Skill)_ can walk the path of the Artificer, and it is this experience that will allow them to combine materials into effects that are greater than the sum of their parts, which many refer to as "Magic Items". Artificers, like regular crafters, utilize recipes for their creations, though the recipe for a magic item is known as a Formula. All Artificers have access to a Standard Library of Formulas, which they may utilize at any time, given they have the appropriate materials to construct the desired item. Other items are known to exist, which are known as "Uncommon Formulas", and Artificers may even attempt to invent their own, but these Formulas must first be created or discovered to utilize new and different items.

>A Magic Item will generally require the following for materials in order to be crafted. A number of materials of various kinds, with a total in material ranks equal to 10 times the Tier of the Magic Item, number of Spirit Gems equal to the Tier of the Item. All Magic Items have a 10 Durability.

>Uncommon Formulas may sometimes be Memorized or even Taught by Artificers. Formulas discovered in the world will have a notation on them indicating if they can be Memorized, and if so, how many times before the Formula is no longer functional. They may also have a notation for how many times a Formula may be Taught after being Memorized, if it may be Memorized at all. If an Uncommon Formula is not capable of being Memorized, or the Artificer does not wish to Memorize it, then when attempting to create the item the Formula must be shown to Logistics before the item tag will be produced.

>Presented here are the Standard Library of Items, as well as any items known to the world at large as "Uncommon Formulas", for which the Formula may be discovered or re-invented,

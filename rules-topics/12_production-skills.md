# Production Skills

Item production is the process by which characters are able to craft consumable items within the game system. These items make up the backbone of the game economy and help support the various skills in the game. There are three material harvesting skills (Foraging, Logging, and Mining) and four crafting skills (Alchemy, Rune Carving, Smithing,  and Artificing).

## Crafting Skill Costs

| Secondary Crafting Skill   | 2+1 | 2+1 | 2+1 | 2+1 | -   |
| Tertiary Crafting Skill | 3+1 | 3+1 | 3+1 | 3+1 | -   |

| _**Recycling Skill**_ | _**F**_ | _**T**_ | _**R**_ | _**M**_ | _**Prereqs**_ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recycling   | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | -   |

## Producing Items
>Production items are set in Tiers from I-X. It takes as many raw materials ranks to make a single item equal to the production item's tier. But wait! Production items are ranked I-X and raw materials are only ranked I-V, and then X; how do I get VI-IX raw materials? The answer to that is to combine the I-V raw materials to equal the tier of the production item that you are making.
>
>Examples:
> 
>To make an Alchemy Tier I item, the character needs to have at least one rank in the Alchemy skill, and would use a single Rank I material. For Alchemy, this is Minor Alchemical Catalyst.
> 
> To make a Smithing Rank 8 item, the character would need at least 8 Ranks in Smithing, and could use a combination of materials where the Ranks, when added up, equal the rank of the item desired. For Smithing this could be one Rank V and three Rank I added up equal enough ranks to make the item.

## Durability
>Any item that is non-consumable has a Durability rating. An item's durability is reduced by one at the beginning of every event, and when an item's Durability reaches 0, it is no longer usable, except for Recycling, see below. A player must check in all items they intend to use or have available to use at the beginning of an event. Any item that is not checked in and has its Durability marked down, is not legal for in-game use until it has been marked by Plot. Consumable items and Materials have an effective Durability of "Until Used", and may not be Recycled.

## Recycling Items
>An item that has been reduced to 0 Durability, destroyed by a spell or skill, or an item that a player no longer wishes to use, may be Recycled by a player with the skill. Items that are in use or activated, such as locks, may not be Recycled.  An item that is Recycled will return 1/3rd of the ranks in materials used to construct it, rounded down to a minimum of one. These materials can either be claimed for future use, or utilized immediately in the construction of a new item. This may _not_ be used on Consumed items.

## Weapon Auras
>By default, a base weapon will use Normal as its **Damage Type**.
> 
>A weapon that has been silvered may only use Silver as its **Damage Type** (ie: it can no longer swing for Normal).
>
> A weapon that has been enchanted with a Magic Aura may only swing Magic as its **Damage Type**, and cannot be silvered. If a weapon is silvered then enchanted, it also becomes a magic sword and may only swing Magic (ie, a weapon with a Magic Aura must always use Magic **Damage Type**†)
>
>A weapon may have only a single flavor or carrier enchantment (ie: a weapon cannot have both Flame Aura and Shock Aura).
>
>TL;DR: A weapon can only swing for Normal, Silver, Magic or Poison **Damage Type**, and can only be changed by a craftsman. Additionally, a weapon may also have up to one flavor/carrier aura, which is optional in the damage call.

|Enchantments|Damage Type|Flavor/Carrier|Attack Calls|
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
|None|Normal|None|1 Normal|
|Flame Aura|Normal|Flame|1 Normal, 1 Normal Flame|
|Silvered|Silver|None|1 Silver|
|Silvered, Shock Aura|Silver|Shock|1 Silver, 1 Silver Shock|
|Magic Aura|Magic|None|1 Magic|
|Magic Aura, Stone Aura|Magic|Stone|1 Magic, 1 Magic Stone|
> 
>† _Weapon Coatings and Monstrous Auras can still be used with a weapon that has a Magic Aura._

## Workshops
>Characters can purchase a Workshop from Logistics for 10 Credits. Workshops have a durability of 10, and their durability is decreased each time they are used for an event by a given character. Workshops can be used to make large-scale batches of an item, doubling the total output for a single character.
>  
>Example: If you attempt to make 10 Heal Wounds potions, this would normally take you 30 Ranks in Alchemical materials. You could either spend 15 ranks, to make 5 potions which will get doubled by the Workshop, or spend the original 30 and get 20 potions instead.  The Workshop must have a durability removed by Logistics during check-in in order to receive any batch production. More than one character may use a workshop for a given event, but each person who uses it will cost one durability.
> 
> Workshops cannot be used to duplicate Artificing items.

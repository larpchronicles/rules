# Artificing

## Artificing
>Artificing is the study of the creation of magic items. Only those with at least a moderate command of each base craft can take the path of an Artificer. The creation of a magic item will vary wildly in its needs based on the item. Magic items always require materials from multiple disciplines. They also require spirit gems for the infusion of their impressive powers. All Artificers have access to a few base recipes that they may craft at will. Other items will require the development or acquisition of a Formula in order to be created. Formulas may also potentially be memorized, or even taught to others, depending on the Formula. Artificing requires 5 ranks in each production type.

## Artificing Products

>Artificers, like regular crafters, utilize recipes for their creations, though the recipe for a magic item is known as a Formula. All Artificers have access to a Standard Library of Formulas, which they may utilize at any time, given they have the appropriate materials to construct the desired item. Other items are known to exist, which are known as "Uncommon Formulas", and Artificers may even attempt to invent their own, but these Formulas must first be created or discovered to utilize new and different items.

>A Magic Item will generally require the following for materials in order to be crafted. A number of materials of various kinds, with a total in material ranks equal to 10 times the Tier of the Magic Item, number of Spirit Gems equal to the Tier of the Item. All Magic Items have a 10 Durability.

>Uncommon Formulas may sometimes be Memorized or even Taught by Artificers. Formulas discovered in the world will have a notation on them indicating if they can be Memorized, and if so, how many times before the Formula is no longer functional. They may also have a notation for how many times a Formula may be Taught after being Memorized, if it may be Memorized at all. If an Uncommon Formula is not capable of being Memorized, or the Artificer does not wish to Memorize it, then when attempting to create the item the Formula must be shown to Logistics before the item tag will be produced.

>Presented here are the Standard Library of Items, as well as any items known to the world at large as "Uncommon Formulas", for which the Formula may be discovered or re-invented,

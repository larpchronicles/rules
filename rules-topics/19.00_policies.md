# Standing Policies

## Transfer Policy

### Character Conversion from Other LARP Systems

---
* You may import your LARP character to Chronicles ONCE.  This is available to players from LARP Systems such as NERO or Alliance LARP, or similarly recognized systems.
* You may choose to have your character transported to Evren from another world (keeping your character's memories and history), OR you may choose to use your skill points to create an entirely new, Evren-based character.
* Importing your character does not invalidate your membership with other LARP organizations or your characters.
* Attending Chronicles events will have no impact on your character in other LARP Systems.
* After conversion, attending non-Chronicles LARP events will have no impact on your Chronicles character.
* All build points transfer to Chronicles as Skill Points.  If this number is below one hundred, you will start with one hundred Skill Points in Chronicles.
* Transforms _may_ transfer into Chronicles, at the discretion of the plot team, on a per-case basis.

### Money, Gems & Items

---
* Coins, gems, and/or bank values from other LARP Systems do not transfer to Chronicles.
* Magic items and/or production items from other LARP Systems do not transfer to Chronicles.


### Goblin Points

---
Goblin Points from other LARP Systems do not transfer to Chronicles, but we do have our own Goblin Point reward system you can participate in.

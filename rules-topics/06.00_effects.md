# Effects

## Effect Sources

---
Sources of the effects below include Monster Abilities, Production, Martial Skills, and Magical Spells.

## Removing Effects

---
The Life spell will remove any ongoing effects of the target's choice.

Dispel Magic and Nullify Spell work on all effects with a magical source unless otherwise specified.

## Visible Effects

---
If a term is denoted as visible, it is something the character is permitted to respond with if a player asks "What do I see?"

If a player is in an unconscious state (Bleeding Out, Sleep, Dead, etc.) and they are asked "What do I see?" the proper response is "Properly Phys-repped", "Recognizable as \[Individual\]", "\[Race\] as I appear" etc.  The response should not include what state the player is in.

## Identifying Non-visible Effects
The Identify ability allows the character to identify an item, a group of items, or target after 1 minute of concentration and continuous contact. This will make the nature and workings of enchantments on an item/creature known to the character, at the discretion of plot. <b>There may be some properties that still remain hidden to the character.</b>

Status that require Identify:
|Identify Needed|
|:---:|
|Animate|
|Curse|
|Curse of Transformation|
|Infect|
|Spirit Bottle|


## Effect Clarifications

---

### Concentration
Concentration consists of being silent, not using skills or items, not running, and typically maintaining physical contact with something. Rest refers to a period of time in which a player does not use abilities or run.  This is done to reset expended abilities or skills.  More information about rest can be found in the Resting section.

### Critical Ability
A character invoking a Critical ability is able to use the specified ability against a single target of their choice. They may continue to use the ability against that target until either the character completes a Rest, or the character invokes another Critical ability (against the same or another target).

### Curse of Transformation
* Curse of Transformation (CoT) makes the target immune to CoT, meaning the effect does not stack.
* Any character or NPC created by CoT is not capable of inflicting CoT on another character. The only time this is not true is for very specific and limited plot reasons.
* There are three types of CoT: Ones that go away on death, ones that go away on resurrection, and ones that go away only with ritual. All COTs may be removed by ritual.
 * If the character is CoT into a skeleton (think like a Greater version of Create Undead), that'll probably go away on death.
 * If the character is CoT into a Vampire, that might go away on Resurrection.
 * If the character is CoT into a Plot device, that might require a ritual.

### Entrapment Clarification
The Entrapment spell allows a caster the chance to capture the spirit of a target. Entrapment works on ANY creature that matches the following:
* Must have human-like intelligence.
* Must be alive.
* Must have a spirit that is **NOT** protected by a SPIRIT BOTTLE effect.
* Must not crumble at 0 body.

### Shattering & Destroying
Shattering or destroying containers that contain things does NOT affect the items within it.

### Skill-less Clarification
Skill-less refers to any abilities purchased with Skill Points. A character does not lose any armor or body gained from purchased skills.

**Physical description characteristics of Curse of Transformations and Transforms are not always uniquely identifiable, and cannot be used to reliably ascertain the presence of a Curse of Transformation.
For instance,  there are many creatures that have fangs, so a "fanged humanoid" is not necessarily a vampire

***Enslavement can be identified by using a Break Enslavement Rune.

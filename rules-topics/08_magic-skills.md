# Magic Skills

## Initiation, Specialization, and Attunement
| Magic Skill Costs     | F     | T   | R    | S   |
|-----------------------|-------|-----|------|-----|
| School Initiation     | 5+5   | 3+4 | 5+5  | 3+1 |
| School Specialization | 20    | 15  | 20   | 10  |
| Mana Attunement       | 10+10 | 3+4 | 10+8 | 3+1 |

### School Initiation
This skill allows a character to be initiated into a school of magic, allowing them to allocate mana points to that school or memorize spells from that school each Rest. This skill may be purchased once for each school of magic (Arcane, Nature, Spirit).  

### School Specialization
When purchased, the character must specify which school they have mastery over. This skill allows that character to use their Mana Points to cast Level 10 spells of the chosen school. This skill may be purchased only once.

Additionally, a character has access to a school-specific ability:
- Arcane: Allows the character to Identify an item or target after 1 minute of concentration and continuous contact. This will make the nature and workings of enchantments on an item/creature known to the character, at the discretion of plot. There may be some properties that still remain hidden to the character.
- Spirit: Allows the character to briefly sense the presence of recently untethered spirits.
- Nature: Allows the character the occasional ability to sense extreme danger, possibly even gaining temporary sight from a nearby animal in a position to warn the character. The character cannot control these abilities, it is entirely up to the Plot Team to determine when the character receives these warnings and visions.

### Mana Attunement
In order to cast a spell, a character must possess the appropriate School Initiation skill, and purchase ranks of Mana Attunement. Each purchase of Mana Attunement adds 10 Mana Points to the character's Mana Pool.

At each Rest (and before first coming into game), the character may distribute their Mana Points across each school for which they possess the School Initiation skill. Their allocation can only be changed once their Rest is completed. Once distributed, the character may cast the spells in that school on the fly, deducting the Mana Point cost of the spell from their points allocated to that school.

Characters may alternatively choose to explicitly memorize their spell list. Doing so grants a bonus 10% total Mana Points to be distruted. The character must mark down how many of which spells they have chosen to memorize, and they may then only cast those spells (until their next Rest).

| **Duration**     | Instant |
| **Incant**     | "By the spirits, I destroy undead." |

#### **Limited Phylactery†**
| **Spell**| **Limited Phylactery†** |
|:---|:---|
| **Duration**     | Rest |
| **Incant**     | "Fiends of the dark nether, create a phylactery for my spirit." |
| **Description** |  This spell will store the caster’s spirit temporarily within a prepared effigy of the character. This spell takes 5 minutes to cast. At the end of the casting of this spell, the caster immediately dies; the caster’s spirit is stored within the effigy, and the caster’s body rises as an undead fully under the control of the character’s spirit. The character’s spirit and their body are magically linked so that the spirit may remotely control the body until the spirit rests. The spirit is limited in which skills are now available to the body, the following skills cannot be used by the body: Weapon Skills (including Claws), Weapon Proficiencies, Physical Strikes, Weapon Strikes, Level 9 spells. The Limited Phylactery effect is not able to be dispelled, and it cannot be recast by the caster until the spirit has rested. The body is considered a greater form of undead for the purposes of spells that only affect lesser forms of undead. Should the body’s health pool be reduced to 0, the caster’s body immediately crumbles and the spell ends, at which point the caster’s spirit returns to the spirit bottle and regenerates their original body with no strain. The phylactery is always destroyable. Should the phylactery be destroyed, the character’s body dies and the spirit must seek resurrection normally, including accruing strain.  This is a SPIRIT BOTTLE effect. |

#### **Create Undead**
| **Spell**            | **Create Undead** |
|:---|:---|
| **Duration**     | 5 minutes |
| **Incant**     | "Fiends of the dark nether, force this minion to rise and serve." |
| **Description** |  This spell will temporarily animate a corpse that has not yet dissipated, binding the target’s spirit to its corpse and pausing its five minute death count. Upon the ending of this effect, the target shall resume their death count from the point at which this effect paused it. The target will remember its actions and the events it observes during the duration of this effect. The target is considered a Minor Undead, and is obviously recognizable as _Undead <Character Name>_, or _Undead &lt;Character Race>_. The target will follow simple commands given by the caster, including speaking a phrase, moving, and using skills. If commanded to speak, the target may only repeat phrases given to it by the caster. The target cannot be compelled to reveal secret information, and it cannot be compelled to take action requiring secret information. _(Ex: the target cannot be commanded to speak the combination to its secret safe, nor can it be commanded to unlock its secret safe.)_ By default, if the target is not given any commands, the target will not speak and simply follow the caster and attack anything that attacks the caster. This is an ANIMATE effect and causes an UNDEAD effect. |

| **Description** | This spell takes 1 minute to cast and requires an untethered spirit. At the beginning of the spell, the target must clearly acknowledge the acceptance of the spell, if they do not, the spell fails to no effect. Once the spell begins, the target's body begins to immediately reform, incurring strain as per a normal resurrection. The caster must be in concentration and unimpeded for the entire casting time of this spell, else the spell will fail. If the caster’s concentration is interrupted, or the reforming body is affected by any detrimental effect, the spell fails and the target immediately suffers a second death. Prior to the casting time the player of the caster, and the player of the untethered spirit, are to verify that the spirit does not have too much strain to resurrect. A marshal should also be present to oversee the process. Once the Resurrection spell is complete, the spirit instantly reforms its body next to the spell caster. The body appears with a full health pool, and all skills renewed as if they had completed a long rest.  This is a LIFE effect. |

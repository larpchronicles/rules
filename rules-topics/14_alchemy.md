>Alchemy is capable of creating a variety of Ingestible Toxins. Each type in turn is capable of being turned into a Weapon Coating, a Dart for Throwing, or a Trap. Above is an easy reference table to show the tier at which a specific Toxin can be made in each of its forms. As a rule of thumb, the base Tier of an item +1 is a Coating, +2 for a Dart or Trap.

### Weapon Coatings
>Weapon coatings are single-use alchemical products that may be applied to weapons. To apply a coating, the user must have the coating in hand and roleplay pouring or rubbing the coating on the weapon for a 5-second count. Only the character who had possession of the weapon when the coating was applied may use that coating.
>
>For example, Alice applies a Sleep Coating to her long sword then hands the sword to Bob. Bob cannot use that coating.
>
>However, if Charlie presents his sword to Diane, who then applies a Sleep Coating to Charlie's sword, then Charlie (and only Charlie) may use that Sleep Coating.
>
>Once applied, the coating will last until it is used or the wielder rests, whichever comes first.
> 
### Toxin Darts
> Toxin Darts function similarly to their Ingestible Counterparts, except they have been processed into an aerosolized gas instead of a powder that must be consumed to take effect. When using a Toxin Dart, the user must throw a packet while declaring "Toxin (Effect)" of the type indicated on the item tag. This cannot be blocked by weapons or shields, much like a Spell Packet.
> 
### Traps
> Traps are pre-placed objects designed to deliver an effect to a small area when their trigger is set off. Trap Reps must be a minimum of 12"x6"x6", to a maximum of 36" in any dimension, and all Trap designs must be approved by a Rules Marshal prior to use. 
> 
> Setting a trap requires a minimum of 1 minute, but the trap is not active until the trigger has been fully set.
> 
> All traps must have a real, physical trigger that is attached to the trap. Setting off the trap must produce a noise or light that is detectable by an impartial observer. It must always be possible to see how to disarm a trap, although it may require light and a small mirror.
> 
> When Toxin traps are activated, it delivers the effects of the Toxin, centered on the trap as "Voice Radius Toxin [Effect]", at a casual speaking volume, such that someone 10 feet away could hear.

At time of creation, Mana, Stamina, or Agility is chosen. This will create an item tag for Elixir of Mana, Elixir of Stamina, or Elixir of Agility. Upon consumption, which takes a three count, the drinker restores 5 points to the chosen resource pool. This cannot be used to bring the user's resource pool above their maximum.
#### Elixir of Invulnerability
> This incredible feat of Alchemical creation, this golden elixir represents the pinnacle of mortal achievement.

For the duration, the drinker cannot speak, use any in-game skills, may not run, and must keep both hands linked with arms pointed down towards their feet. After the effect ends, the drinker may not benefit from another Elixir of Invulnerability until they complete a rest. This Elixir does not provide any protection from Aether abilities. This item is consumed on use.
#### Elixir of Venom Spitting
> This strange elixir was created to mimic the abilities of foul monstrosities who can spit toxins like rain upon their enemies. The next time the drinker would suffer from a Toxin, they instead declare "Resist Absorb", and the drinker can then throw 5 instances of "Activate Toxin <Effect>" with no longer than 3 seconds between each throw, otherwise the effect ends. At the end of this period, the Elixir of Venom Spitting fades, and they may not benefit from an Elixir of Venom Spitting until they complete a rest. If the defense is not used prior to resting, the defense is lost. This takes a defense slot. This item is consumed on use.

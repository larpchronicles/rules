### One-Handed Weapon 

>This skill allows the character to use one hand weapon between 24" long and less than 48" long in melee combat.  One-Handed weapons include short swords, short axes, short hammer, short club, long swords, rapier, battleaxe, warhammer, warmace, spear, and club.  This skill allows the use of the weapon in either hand, but not the ability to wield a One-Handed Weapon in both hands at once.

### Two-Handed Weapon

>The character may use a two-handed weapon between 48" long and 72" long in melee combat. Two-Handed weapons include two-handed swords, polearms, staves, and two-handed clubs. Two-handed weapons require both hands to be on the weapon in order to attack or block in melee combat. If the character blocks an attack with only one hand, the character will take the damage as if they had not blocked the attack at all.

### Ranged Weapon

>This skill allows the character to use a ranged weapon in combat. Ranged weapons include bow, crossbow, and throwing weapons. Bows and crossbows may be used to block attacks, but must be restrung prior to continued use.

### Shield

>This skill allows the character to wield a shield used to block attacks. A shield may never be used for striking in combat. As long as the character has either hand on a shield, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the shield is considered effectively blocked.  The maximum surface area of a shield is 531 square inches. The longest dimension a shield may have is 36".  Shields may not be used with two-handed weapons, bows, or crossbows. A character may not dual wield shields.

### Parrying Dagger
>This skill allows the user to wield a parrying dagger used to block attacks.   The parrying dagger may never be used for striking in combat. As long as the character is wielding the parrying dagger in one hand, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the parrying dagger is considered effectively blocked. The parrying dagger meet safety requirements of any other weapon.  The parrying dagger must be between 12"-18" in length, the handle is a maximum of 6", and the tips of the weapon must be red for easy identification.

### Dual Wield

>This skill allows the character to wield two One-Handed Weapons, one in each hand, while in combat. At least one weapon must be of Short Length or lower. This skill does not apply other skills or abilities to both weapon hands. <br/>Requires the One-Handed Weapon skill.



## Physical Strikes

---
Physical strikes are weapon delivered combat effects used by characters. A physical strike is delivered once using a weapon attack, and must strike the target character successfully without being blocked in order to be a successful attack. Physical strikes are considered used whether the attack was successful or not. Physical strikes that are blocked by shields or weapons, have been blocked and are considered unsuccessful attacks. Unsuccessful physical strikes and physical strikes that have been resisted can be regained by the character resting. Physical strike effects are not magical in nature; therefore, they cannot be removed by the Dispel Magic spell or any removal skill that is limited to effects of magical origin only.

## Rest-Boosting Skills

---
#### Performing
>This skill allows other characters to benefit from a short, relaxing performance. Performances can be of a wide variety of entertaining performance arts. These include, but are not limited to, Scene Acting, Poetry Recital, Singing, Dancing, Instrumental Performance, Spoken Word, Dramatic Reading, etc. 
>
>Performances speed the recovery time of Rest. For each 5 minutes that a performer performs, the audience's base Rest time of 2 hours is reduced by 15 minutes. Rest time may never be lowered to less than 30 minutes. To benefit from a performance, a character must be present through an entire 5 minute block of the performance. Performers should announce "Now performing!" at the beginning of each 5 minute block. This is not a requirement. 
>
>Performances require concentration. If the performer stops their performance for longer than 1 minute, or the performer suffers an attack that is NOT part of the performance, then the performance is stopped with no benefit for that block of time. 
>
>If multiple performers perform at the same time there is no increase in efficacy, however performers may alternate between one another to maintain a performance without interruption. For each rank in Performing that a performer has, the performer may benefit an audience for one block of time per Rest. Use of this skill does not interrupt Resting.

|Ranks|Performance Time|Time Reduction|Audience Rest Time|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1|5min|15min|1hr 45min|
|2|10min|30min|1hr 30min|
|3|15min|45min|1hr 15min|
|4|20min|60min|1hr|
|5|25min|75min|45min|
|6|30min|90min|30min|

## Miscellaneous Skills

---
#### First Aid
>This skill is purchased once. First Aid allows the character to provide emergency aid to a dying character. The character using First Aid will touch the downed character and say "Performing First Aid". While First Aid is being applied, the dying count of the targeted character stops. First Aid takes a base time of 1 minute to apply. Other in-game tools can lessen this time. The character rendering First Aid is under concentration while providing the First Aid. Once the 1 minute is complete for First Aid, the downed character's body is restored to 1.
> 
>This skill also allows a character to touch a downed or seemingly disabled character and ask, "First Aid, what do I see?"  If the character is under an effect that can be diagnosed by first aid, or is a visible effect, the player may reply with the specific effect ("Are you Dead", "Are you Bleeding Out", "Are you reviving", etc).  The character may also ask how long a countdown remains on first aid or visible effects ("How long until you dissipate", "How long until you’re dead", etc).  The character cannot ask how long the timer was, just its current time left).  
>
>The following statuses and countdown timers can be determined with first aid (status under Visible Effect do not need first aid to see the target is affected but is needed to determine the countdown timer).

#### Escape Artist
>This skill is purchased multiple times. Each time this skill is purchased, the character may escape from magical, or non-magical bindings by completing a 3 second count of escaping the bonds. "1 I escape binding...2 I escape binding…" This skill is refreshed each Rest.

#### Trapping
 >This skill is purchased once. Trapping allows the character the chance to set a trap using the in-game trap tag, trap physical representation, and trap trigger. Setting a trap takes as long as it actually takes to set the trap. Trapping also allows the character to attempt to disarm a set trap using out of game and in-game tools. The character must actually disarm the trigger of the trap, and do so without destroying the trigger. Most disarmed traps can be saved for later use.

#### Lockpicking
>This skill is purchased multiple times. Each skill rank indicates the proficiency of the character in picking locks. To pick a lock, the character must provide their own draw bag and several beads in each of four colors. One color represents success (one bead). One color represents breaking the lock (one bead). One color represents that the character can continue the attempt (several beads), And one color represents resetting the bag (several beads). The base bag has 1 success, 1 break, 4 continue, 1 reset. The character's skill rank is compared to the tier of the lock. For each rank that the character's skill is under the lock, add 2 continue and 1 reset. If the character's skill is equal to, or above the lock there is no change to the bag. The character may draw from the bag every 30 seconds until success, or the lock is broken.
> 
> Broken locks are jammed and can no longer be picked. A tinkerer must repair the broken lock before the lock can be picked again. This repair is a tier III skill requiring 3 tinkering materials. Repairing a broken lock takes 1 minute.

#### Cutpurse
>This skill is purchased once. Cutpurse skill requires the use of Pick Pocket Tools from Tinkering. The player slips the tool onto the pouch, or pocket, and goes to notify a Game Marshal. The Game Marshal will approach the picked character and retrieve one random game item from the picked character. If there is nothing in the picked pouch, then the larceny has resulted in no reward. The transfer of goods from Game Marshal to thief takes place out of sight from other players.

#### Tracking
>This skill is purchased once. Using this skill, the character can attempt to track a target's tracks. The target tracks are assigned a value according to weather, ground, recency, and skill of the target hiding their tracks. With all that taken in, the resulting modified track number is compared to the trackers number.
>
>Tracking can be combined with the survivalist knowledge skill to gain greater bonuses and be considered master tracker.
> 
>When a player asks to track something/someone a marshal will determine if the tracking succeeds and how much information a player gets.  PCs cannot track other PCs.

## Knowledge Skills

>Knowledge skills are a way through which characters can gather information about the world around them. These skills are gained automatically as you gain SP, choosing a Profession and Hobby, with your Profession being your "main focus" and scaling faster. Once you have capped a Profession or Hobby at Rank 10, you may select a new one immediately to begin scaling, and it starts with 1 rank. A Profession goes up in rank every 50 SP, and each Hobby goes up in rank every 100 SP. So you will unlock your second Profession at 450 SP, and both your Second Hobby and Third Profession at 900 SP, and so on. Each knowledge skill represents a specific area of expertise that a character can improve upon. These skills might be utilized when interacting with Plot to help you discover more information about what is happening during a particular scene, or Plot may choose to ask for Knowledge skills leading into an adventure to help flesh out what the characters might have discovered.
>
>Generally, any piece of information that you attempt to discover will be assigned a secret "Difficulty Class" by the Plot member, on a scaling slide of 1 through 10. A Difficulty Class of 1 would represent fairly common knowledge, something that most anyone who cares about the subject would know. A 10 on the other hand would represent particularly unusual or rare information, something that only a true expert in the field would have discovered. If you have enough ranks in the chosen skill to meet the difficulty class, you may learn some useful information. Having less than the set Difficulty may result in incomplete or slightly misleading information, while having more ranks than the required Difficulty may result in getting more detailed or extra information.

#### Arcane Knowledge
>Covers Arcane Magic in all its forms and uses, constructs and celestial events. Higher ranks will provide greater insight to arcane questions, or provide more detailed information on the target of your inquiry.

#### Criminal Knowledge
>Covers laws (their avoidance and subversion), various criminal organizations and their structure, cons, and illegal activity. Higher ranks will point you to contacts within some of these organizations, or reveal information you may regret knowing.

#### Economic Knowledge
>Covers trade routes, values of goods, and merchants of specific items. Higher ranks will reveal more hidden information, or let you sniff out particularly good deals.

#### Geographical Knowledge
>Covers landmarks, terrain, maps, roads, approximate distances and navigation. Higher ranks will allow for more detailed information or better navigation.

#### Historical Knowledge
>Covers recent to far flung historical events. Higher ranks will allow for knowledge of the distant past, or more accurate recollections of events.

#### Nature Knowledge
>Covers Nature Magic in all its forms and uses, beasts, plants and weather patterns. Higher ranks will provide greater insight to nature questions, or provide more detailed information on the target of your inquiry.

#### Political Knowledge
>Covers laws (their enforcement and creation), local and foreign political hierarchy, alliances and hostilities, territories and holdings. Higher ranks will reveal well-hidden information, or let you find the truth behind malicious rumors.

#### Spirit Knowledge
>Covers Spirit Magic in all its forms and uses, undead and nether spirits. Higher ranks will provide greater insight to spirit questions, or provide more detailed information on the target of your inquiry.

#### Survivalist Knowledge
>Covers skills needed for living in the wild, such as hunting, fishing, and identifying plants and animals.  A survivalist may be able to recognize the mark left by a creature but to truly track them they will need the tracking skill.

#### Theology Knowledge
>Covers churches, cults, religious beliefs, deities, and demigods. Higher ranks will reveal more in-depth information on various groups, or reveal hidden aspects.

## Skillset Prioritization
Chronicles uses a classless skill system where players may choose primary and secondary skillsets for their character from three: Fighter, Mage, and Rogue.  The skillset not chosen as a primary or secondary will become the character's tertiary.  Choosing these skillsets will adjust the skill point costs of the skills within each skillset.  The available skillsets are named thematically for their related skills, which can give the average player a general idea of what they modify.

### Fighter Skillset
This skillset has a higher focus on the skills most related to fighting.  It has reduced costs for skills like weapon proficiencies, armor, shield, and stamina.

### Mage Skillset
This skillset has a higher focus on the skills most related to magic.  It has reduced costs for skills like magic school initiations and attunement.  It does not have reduced costs for ritual magic.

### Rogue Skillset
This skillset has a higher focus on the skills most related to subterfuge and utility.  It has reduced costs for skills such ass agility, lockpicking, trapping, and escaping.

### General Skillset
This skillset encompasses skills that have a general availability.  There are no cost adjustments for the skills in this skillset.  This skillset cannot be chosen as a primary, secondary, or tertiary skillset.

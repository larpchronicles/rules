| Magic Skill Costs  | F  | T | R | M |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| School Initiation  | 5+5 | 3+4 | 5+5  | 3+1 |
| School Specialization | 20 | 15  | 20 | 10  |
| Mana Attunement | 10+10 | 3+4 | 10+8 | 3+1 |

### School Initiation
This skill allows a character to be initiated into a school of magic, allowing them to allocate mana points to that school or memorize spells from that school each Rest. This skill may be purchased once for each school of magic (Arcane, Nature, Spirit).  

### School Specialization
When purchased, the character must specify which school they have mastery over. This skill allows that character to use their Mana Points to cast Level 10 spells of the chosen school. This skill may be purchased only once.

### Mana Attunement
In order to cast a spell, a character must possess the appropriate School Initiation skill, and purchase ranks of Mana Attunement. Each purchase of Mana Attunement adds 10 Mana Points to the character's Mana Pool. Casting a spell will remove a number of Mana Points from their pool equal to the spell's level.

At each Rest (and before first coming into game), the character may distribute their Mana Points across each school for which they possess the School Initiation skill. Their allocation can only be changed once their Rest is completed. Once distributed, the character may cast the spells in that school on the fly, deducting the Mana Point cost of the spell from their points allocated to that school.

Characters may alternatively choose to explicitly memorize their spell list. Doing so grants a bonus 10% total Mana Points to be distributed. The character must mark down how many of which spells they have chosen to memorize, and they may then only cast those spells (until their next Rest).

## Casting Method
When you check in a character for an event you can choose between packet throwing and spellstiking as your prefered magic delivery method.  You cannot switch between methods without plots permission.  You may have certain magic items or transform abilities that use the alternate method.

## Spellstrikes

Spellstrikes are spells cast upon a target via a physically represented weapon. Spellstrikes may not be refused in the way touch casts can.Defenses for spells such as Spell Mirror, Intercept, and Parry Spell are effective against Spellstrikes. The Parry skill will not block the spell of aSpellstrike. If a player physically parries a Spellstrike, they take the effect of the spell. An individual capable of using Spellstrike may treat wielded weapon as a spell packet for the purposes of touch-casting. Packets may not be used to Spellstrike.  A player must be proficient in the weapon they are using to Spellstrike

### Universal Level 1
#### **Glowing Light**
| Spell | **Glowing Light** |
|:---|:---|
| **School**|  Universal |
| **Level**| 1 |
| **Duration**  | 12 hours | |
| **Incant** | "I conjure a glowing light." |
| **Description** | This spell allows the character to use a filtered light in game. Typical reps for a light include a small filtered flashlight or a glow stick less than 6" in length. Make sure that your light is only emitting a soft glow and not a sharp directed light as a game marshal may ask you to extinguish your light! The light is bound to the caster of the spell; should the caster be affected by a Dispel Magic spell or die, this spell will end immediately. A Glowing Light cannot be passed from one character to another. |

### Universal Level IV

| **Description** | This spell attempts to claim a portion of the target's essence into a Spirit Gem, which is a material used for Ritual Magic and Magic Item creation. This spell may be cast on a target up to 20 seconds after it dissipates. This spell only generates a Spirit Gem if the target does dissipate. The Caster should interact with the target if possible to collect their Spirit Gem. If this isn't possible, the Caster should Roleplay the moment as if cast normally, but must see Plot to collect their gems. A caster may only receive a single spirit gem from a target, regardless of how many Entrap Spirits are cast upon it. |

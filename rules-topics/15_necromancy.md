# Necromancy Update

## Definition:

---
Necromancy is referred to as a branch of Spirit Magic primarily focused on the creation, preservation, and manipulation of undead creatures. This includes any spell where the incant begins with _"Fiends of the Dark Nether…"_, and creates, animates, heals, or controls undead specifically.

## Synopsis:

---
* Animate undead without making yourself vulnerable to Dark Fiends.
* Only works on permanently dead bodies that have also been specially prepared.
* Corpses may be animated repeatedly, by different casters, though they need to be prepared and possibly repaired between animations.
* "Renting" a corpse from the Necromancer's Guild of Varos requires a Necromancy License.

## Historical Necromancy and Its Current Function:

---
The current understanding of Necromancy and its associated magics is that each invocation of a Necromantic spell leaves the caster's spirit open and vulnerable to corruption by these Fiends, as the caster is borrowing their power to complete the spell.

Over time, this can lead to the necromancer losing themselves as their Spirit degrades, becoming vulnerable to being completely possessed by a Dark Fiend seeking to escape their imprisonment from within the Dark Nether.

As the caster is relying on powers outside of their own mana to assist in the control, creation, and manipulation of the undead, the only limit to the number of undead that can be raised by a single Necromancer is the magnitude of their magical attunement. Fiendish Necromancy is also potent enough to overtake any remaining connection between a body and its spirit while it is weakened by death, and force the body to act according to the caster's will. This can prevent a Spirit from undergoing a cycle of Death and Resurrection, which has led to the argument that Necromancy disrupts the natural order of Life and Death.


## New Necromancy and Its Function:

---
The focus of this new research has been to eliminate the need for a necromancer to call upon external forces, such as Fiends of the Nether, when animating a body thus eliminating the risk of corruption. Rather than borrowing the power of a Fiend to possess and animate a target, the caster themself acts as a puppeteer of a spiritless corpse by infusing the target with their own mana to act as a replacement for the departed Spirit.

This means that "Traditional"_(aka, Fiendish)_ Necromantic practices still exist, but this method can allow for a caster to perform some spells of similar function without the risk to their person or others.

### Restrictions:

Unfortunately, research into this new branch of Necromancy is still ongoing and an individual caster is not yet able to meet the same level of power as a caster calling upon the Fiends might be able to achieve.

1. This method may ONLY be used on targets who are permanently dead, ie, the body of a person whose spirit has crossed into the Eternal Graveyard and thus cannot return from their final Rest. As the caster is the sole source of magic for the reanimation of a body, this means that the caster cannot contend with external forces acting upon the target body, such as a still tethered Spirit attempting to return to it. This means the animated corpse retains no memories of its previous life, nor does it possess the ability to recall information from previous reanimations.
2. The concentration required to maintain the body's reanimation means a necromancer can only animate one target at a time for a limited duration before they must rest to cast the spell again. If the spell is disrupted, or the body is damaged to the point of being unable to carry out commands, the caster must rest before attempting to reanimate the body again.
3. The corpse must also undergo a specialized method of preparation prior to being animated via this method. Without this preparation, the necromancer will not be able to anchor upon the corpse the magics that allow for the body to be animated according to the caster's will. This is the final reason a found corpse, or newly dead body is unable to be raised and reanimated using this method.


### Benefits:

While this style of Necromancy may be seen as less powerful on the surface, it does have several benefits that the previous method lacks. 

1. This method DOES NOT work on individuals that were not previously willing to allow for their body to be used in such a manner and does not affect the cycle of Life and Death, as it requires the Spirit to have crossed to the Eternal Graveyard.
2. Fiendish Necromancy overwhelmingly leads to the creation of an undead creature that is weaker than the necromancer raising it. , This new method can allow for bodies of varying strength and skill to be preserved to some degree and reanimated by a caster of minimally sufficient skill, regardless of the overall strength of the reanimated body.
3. Undead raised by Fiendish means had little to none of their abilities they possessed while alive, unless raised by significantly powerful necromantic means. This method can allow for some skill and ability previously possessed by the body to be retained, though death does appear to diminish the overall ability the individual once possessed while alive.
4. Undead created by calling upon the Fiends of the Dark Nether seem to have an extremely limited duration that they can function before they are unable to continue acting according to the will of the caster. Bodies reanimated using this newly developed method do not crumble or otherwise become unusable at the conclusion of the spell. Additionally, the duration of their ability to stay animated and under the control of the necromancer is significantly longer than previous known animation spells.
5. Animated Undead are also beholden to the master that raised them, though other powerful undead may also be able to control them. Bodies reanimated using this new method are not rendered unusable upon the conclusion of the spell. When the animation magic expires, or if the undead corpse is reduced to 0 body, the corpse should be brought back to the Necromancer's Guild of Varos, where it will be made ready to be animated again.


## Reanimation Process:

---
In order for a body to be suitable for reanimation, it has been mentioned it must undergo several steps to be suitable for use following an individual's final death:


### Preparation:

1. Prior to death, an individual must give their **uncoerced** consent that their body may be utilized following their final death. This process is handled via a signed contract that the individual may cancel at any time should they find they have a change of heart or other circumstances arise. All contracts will be kept on file within the Necromancer's Guild, specifying the duration of time the body will be maintained until its final burial, and any wishes of the individual in regards to their remains following the conclusion of their contract.

   Further steps in the process ensure that unwillingness or coercion on behalf of the individual will clash with the magics that allow for reanimation and the body will not animate. This is to ensure that EVERY body employed in this manner were willing volunteers.

2. The living individual is subject to a specialized ritual that creates a unique magic circle that acts as a "signature" or imprint of the individual's Spirit. This imprint contains the sum of their skills and abilities and allows the body and caster to utilize those abilities

   even after their death. This circle is sealed and kept on record with their contract, but is unable to be used until the individual endures their final death, as it is only compatible with their body bearing no tethered Spirit.

3. Upon the individual's permanent death, the created magic circle is affixed permanently to the body to act as a conduit for the eventual link between the body and caster during the process or reanimation. The body is treated to ensure the progression of decay is prevented, though it is possible that during the process of imprinting the body may be deemed more suitable to undergo a period of decomposition for one reason or another, prior to its first reanimation.

### Reanimation:

Only individuals granted a license to practice Necromancy by the Necromancer's Guild of Varos are allowed access to these prepared bodies, though they are available at any time for members who remain in good standing with the Guild and Kingdom.

Members may select from any available body and will place a deposit on hold with the Guild to be returned when the body is returned at the end of the reanimation period. **Failure to return the body for <span style="text-decoration:underline;">any</span> reason will result in a forfeiture of the deposit. **All funds go toward the continued maintenance of the bodies in the Guild's care, preparation of incoming bodies, and funerary services for the bodies at the conclusion of their contract.

Members will be presented with information relevant to each body to assist in their decision to select one suitable for their current needs. Once a selection is made, the caster must perform a short ritual which includes the phrase, _"Empty Vessel, Arise Once More and Serve Me."_

Should the body be properly prepared, the circle will activate and the body will reanimate and follow the caster's commands. casters will gain an innate knowledge of all of the body's abilities upon the establishment of the link.

Reanimated bodies will follow short, simple commands such as:

- _"Defend me."_

- _"Attack anything wearing a green shirt"_

-	_"Guard this spot."_

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but an example of the types of commands that could be given to a reanimated body.

The animation will last for approximately two hours after reanimation or the duration of one adventure module, at which time the body will become unresponsive and unable to be reanimated until it has been returned to the guild. The caster will be unable to animate another corpse until they complete a rest.


## Spells and Legality:

---
**_<u>ALL forms of Necromancy, undead, and reanimated bodies are still illegal within Varos' city boundaries, regardless of a Necromancer's Guild of Varos license, and will be punished in accordance with Kingdom Law.</u>_**

All spells with the incantations that include "Fiends of the Dark Nether" are still highly dangerous to the caster and considered ILLEGAL. Any caught using such spells will be punished according to Kingdom Law.


## Out of Game Information:

---
### NPCs:

To help alleviate strain on the Plot Team, Players who wish to reanimate a body will need to provide their own NPC. Players will <u>not</u> be given a stat card for their reanimated body until the NPC is present, and the reanimation timer will "begin" upon the Player and NPC leaving the Necromancer's Guild. (Time spent waiting to begin a mod will not count toward this timer)

NPCs volunteering for this role are allowed to stop at any time, regardless of the duration left before the repped body becomes unresponsive, though this is discouraged if not for medical reasons or discomfort with the current ongoing plot.

NPCing in this manner may count toward a player's NPC shift, though this will be determined on a case-by-base basis.


### Stat Cards:

Players will be given short descriptions correlating to the "available" bodies and may vary from day-to-day or event-to-event depending on In Game activities. Descriptions could contain information such as the body's former name, occupation, notable accomplishments, and other relevant details.

No actual stats will be revealed until a body is selected and reanimated, at which time the Player and NPC will be given the relevant stat card to use for the duration of the spell. If the

Player does not find the reanimated body suitable for their needs, they are free to end the reanimation spell early, but must still complete a rest before making another selection.


### Combat:

Reanimated bodies are intrinsically linked to the will of their caster. While verbal commands are needed to control a reanimated body, NPCs must follow all given commands to the best of their abilities, until a new command is given or they complete the task given to them. At no time may an NPC deliberately misinterpret a caster's orders.

Unless otherwise specified by the stat card, all reanimated bodies:

* Cannot run in direct sunlight
* Will not defend themselves unless ordered to, or currently engaged in combat
* Have no metabolism

If a caster is unable to give verbal commands, such as under the effects of a _Silence_ spell, the NPC must wait until the caster is again able to command them.

If an NPC reaches 0 body, the spell reanimating them is broken, regardless of any time remaining on the spell. The NPC will give the caster their stat card and must then inform the Plot Team leading the mod (once it is safe/prudent to do so) that they are no longer animated. At which point they may join the mod NPCs or return to town to resume their character's activities. If the body is destroyed or unable to be retrieved for some reason, the NPC may be required to hand over their stat card to the Plot Team instead.

Once this occurs, it is the responsibility of the caster to decide how to roleplay what is done with the body. For example, if they decide to carry the body with them, they must roleplay carrying the body's dead weight, picking it up, and setting it down when appropriate.

### Returning a Body:

Players using a body maintained by the Necromancer's Guild are to return the body following the conclusion of the mod, as bringing a reanimated body into Varos may have unintended consequences for the Player.

To return the body, the Player (with or without the NPC) must return the stat card to the Necromancy Guild. They will then be given back their deposit, and be able to utilize the Guild's services again once their rest is complete.

Failure to return a body will result in the forfeiture of the deposit, and may result in the loss of Guild privileges.

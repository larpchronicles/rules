### Weapon Specific Rules ###
| WEAPON | RULE |
|:---|:---|
| All Weapons | All combat reps must be certified as safe. Safety checks for all combat reps may be performed at check-in.  Safety checks MUST be performed EVERY EVENT; they do not carry over from prior events.  A marshal may request to inspect your reps at any time during the event, and, if deemed unsafe, may lose their safety certification.|
| Bites | Must be made to normal weapon specs, including approved core materials and must have more than a 4" striking surface.|
| Blunt Weapons | Attacks must be swings.  May not stab with any of these weapon types.|
| Claws | Must be made to normal weapon specs, including approved core materials and must have more than a 4" striking surface.|
| Polearm | Attacks must be swings.  May not stab with this weapon type.|
| Spear (One-Handed) | Attacks must be stabs.  May not swing this weapon type.|

### Stab and Swing Attacks ###
Stabbing is defined as an attack where the weapon is thrust toward and/or into the target such that the head or end of the weapon will connect with the target's body.

Swinging is defined as an attack where the weapon is swung with a sweeping movement toward the target such that the striking surface of the weapon will connect with the target's body.  Swinging must be done with the weapon's head pointed to the ground.

### Striking Surface ### 
The striking surface specifies the minimum and maximum amount of padded striking surface the weapon *must* have. _Any weapon that has less padding than the specified minimums will not pass inspection, even if it falls within the Total Length requirements!_

### Handle Length ###
The handle length specifies the minimum and maximum length of the handle by which the weapon can be wielded or held.

`Example: A Short Sword with a 14" handle will have to be at least 32" long overall, to accommodate the minimum striking surface length of 18" (14" handle + 18" striking surface = 32" total length). It is not possible to make a 24" long Short Sword that has a 14" handle; the blade would be only 10" long, which is less than the minimum (18") for the striking surface of a short sword.`

### Weapon Heads ###
Axes, blunt weapons, and polearms are required to have an open cell foam "head" that clearly conveys what the weapon represents. The minimum size of a weapon head is 4"x2"x2".

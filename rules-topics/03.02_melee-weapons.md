* All combat reps must be certified as safe. Safety checks for all combat reps may be performed at check-in.  Safety checks MUST be performed EVERY EVENT; they do not carry over from prior events.  A marshal may request to inspect your reps at any time during the event, and, if deemed unsafe, may lose their safety certification.
* Claws / Bites must be made to normal weapon specs, including approved core materials and must have more than a 4" striking surface.

### Striking Surface ### 
The striking surface specifies the minimum and maximum amount of padded striking surface the weapon *must* have. _Any weapon that has less padding than the specified minimums will not pass inspection, even if it falls within the Total Length requirements!_

### Handle Length ###
The handle length specifies the minimum and maximum length of the handle by which the weapon can be wielded or held.

`Example: A Short Sword with a 14" handle will have to be at least 32" long overall, to accommodate the minimum striking surface length of 18" (14" handle + 18" striking surface = 32" total length). It is not possible to make a 24" long Short Sword that has a 14" handle; the blade would be only 10" long, which is less than the minimum (18") for the striking surface of a short sword.`

### Weapon Heads ###
Axes, blunt weapons, and polearms are required to have an open cell foam "head" that clearly conveys what the weapon represents. The minimum size of a weapon head is 4"x2"x2".

## Additional Defense Slot  
This skill grants an additional Defense Slot which may be used to activate additional defenses.  A character may only have as many Active Defenses as they have Defensive Slots.  Any skill, ability, or effect that grants a Resist or Dodge requires a Defensive Slot to be prepared.  This includes Transforms.  All characters automatically have 1 Defense Slot for free and additional slots may be purchased with Skill Points.

## Dexterity Armor  
This skill adds 5 points of Dexterity Armor to the character for each purchase of the skill. Dexterity armor does not require a physrep.  Dexterity armor does not stack with any other source of armor.  This armor exists independently of and does not interact with the character's Armor Cap, and does not require the Armor Training skill. Refitting Dexterity Armor requires 1 minute of concentration, during which player must roleplay stretching, yoga, shadowboxing, etc..

## First Aid  
First Aid allows the character to provide emergency aid to a dying character. The character using First Aid will touch the downed character and say "Performing First Aid". While First Aid is being applied, the dying count of the targeted character stops. First Aid takes a base time of 1 minute to apply.  The character rendering First Aid is under concentration while providing the First Aid. Once the 1 minute is complete for First Aid, the downed character's body is restored to 1.

## Meditate
A character may spend 1 minute in deep concentration (any interaction, including moving or speaking, will interrupt this concentration) to regain any Mana Points, Agility Points, or Stamina Points expended on any ability that failed to connect with their intended target since their last Rest or Meditate. This only applies to abilities where the attack missed, and not does not apply to abilities that the target defended against or was immune to. This ability does not allow a character to exceed their maximum pool points.

## Identify  
Identify allows a character to spend 1 minute concentrating while maintaining contact with a person or items to determine what, if any, magical properties the target has.

## Parrying Dagger  
This skill allows the character to wield a parrying dagger used to block attacks.   The parrying dagger may never be used for striking in combat. As long as the character is wielding the parrying dagger in one hand, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the parrying dagger is considered effectively blocked. The parrying dagger meet safety requirements of any other weapon.  The parrying dagger must be between 12"-18" in length, the handle is a maximum of 6", and the tips of the weapon must be red for easy identification.

## Ritual Magic  
This skill allows the character to access the standard ritual magic library.  More information can be found in the Ritual Magic section.

## Specialization  
When purchased, the character must specify which skillset they have mastery over. This skill allows that character to access level 10 abilities or spells.  This skill may be purchased only once.

## Spell Strike  
All characters choose between being able to packet-deliver their spells, or spellstrike their spells. This choice cannot be changed during an event.

## Tap Reserves  
All characters have the ability to summon reserve energy when necessary. Tap Reserves allows a character to spend 1 minute in concentration to set the ability pool associated with their Primary skillset to 5 points. This requires the character to have a maximum of at least 5 points in their primary skillset ability pool. (A Fighter primary character can set their Stamina Points to 5, a Rogue primary character can set their Agility Points to 5, and a Mage primary character can set their Mana Points to 5.) Note: This does NOT increasse their current pool points by 5, it sets the pool to 5 points. If the character had greater than 5 points in their pool prior to using Tap Reserves, they would be effectively losing points in that pool.) A character may never be compelled to use this ability by any means, it is always the choice of the player to use Tap Reserves.

## Tracking  
This skill is purchased once. Using this skill, the character can attempt to track a target. The target tracks are assigned a value according to weather, ground, recency, and skill of the target hiding their tracks. With all that taken in, the resulting modified track number is compared to the trackers number.  When a player asks to track something/someone a marshal will determine if the tracking succeeds and how much information a player gets. PCs cannot track other PCs.  Tracking can be augmented by some Knowledges, which may grant a character additional information or lower a difficulty.  Some examples of this:  Survivalist Knowledge may give a bonus in the wild.  Criminal Knowledge may give a bonus in a city or if criminal knowledge may be applicable to the target – such smuggler’s marks.  These are not guaranteed, so it is always best to ask when initially asking to track. 

## Foraging  
This skill is the is used to gather the materials for the Alchemy Skill. Foraging represents the character collecting herbs, reagents, or catalysts for use with the Alchemy skill.

## Logging  
This skill is the is used to gather the materials for the Rune Carving Skill. Logging represents the character collecting pieces of wood for use with the Rune Carving skill.

## Smithing

## Artificing  
This skill allows the character to craft advanced magical items from a standard library of recipes.  This skill requires the character to have 5 ranks in every crafting skill (Alchemy, Smithing, Rune Carving).

## Recycling  
The Recycling skill allows the character to reclaim some of the raw materials used to craft an item that has been reduced to 0 Durability, been destroyed, or is an item no longer desired.  Items that are in use or activated may not be recycled.  Recycling returns 1/3rd of the materials used to construct it, rounded down to a minimum of one. These materials can either be claimed for future use or utilized immediately in the construction of a new item. This may not be used on consumable items.

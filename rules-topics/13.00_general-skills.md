## Additional Defense Slot
>This skill grants an additional Defense Slot which may be used to activate additional defenses.  A character may only have as many Active Defenses as they have Defensive Slots.  Any skill, ability, or effect that grants a Resist, Reflect, or Dodge requires a Defensive Slot to be prepared.  This includes Transforms.  All characters automatically have 1 Defense Slot for free and additional slots may be purchased with Skill Points.

## Dexterity Armor
> This skill adds 5 points of armor to the character for each time that this skill is purchased. Dexterity armor does not need to be represented by a physical representation.  Dexterity armor does not stack with any other source of armor except the 5 points of Armor every character gets by default.  This skill is not blocked by resting.  Dexterity armor take 1 minute of stretching (Concentration) to refit in which the player must roleplay stretching, yoga, etc.  Dexterity armor cannot exceed the character's Armor Training Cap.
>
> **With Dexterity Armor active, a character may not benefit from any physical armor (including enchantments).**


## First Aid
>This skill is purchased once. First Aid allows the character to provide emergency aid to a dying character. The character using First Aid will touch the downed character and say "Performing First Aid". While First Aid is being applied, the dying count of the targeted character stops. First Aid takes a base time of 1 minute to apply. Other in-game tools can lessen this time. The character rendering First Aid is under concentration while providing the First Aid. Once the 1 minute is complete for First Aid, the downed character's body is restored to 1.
> 
>This skill also allows a character to touch a downed or seemingly disabled character and ask, "First Aid, what do I see?"  If the character is under an effect that can be diagnosed by first aid, or is a visible effect, the player may reply with the specific effect ("Are you Dead", "Are you Bleeding Out", "Are you reviving", etc).  The character may also ask how long a countdown remains on first aid or visible effects ("How long until you dissipate", "How long until you're dead", etc).  The character cannot ask how long the timer was, just its current time left).  
>
>The following statuses can be determined with first aid.  First aid can determine the countdown timer on statuses that are diagnosed with physical effects or first aid.

## Parrying Dagger
>This skill allows the user to wield a parrying dagger used to block attacks.   The parrying dagger may never be used for striking in combat. As long as the character is wielding the parrying dagger in one hand, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the parrying dagger is considered effectively blocked. The parrying dagger meet safety requirements of any other weapon.  The parrying dagger must be between 12"-18" in length, the handle is a maximum of 6", and the tips of the weapon must be red for easy identification.


## Specialization
>When purchased, the character must specify which skillset they have mastery over. This skill allows that character to access level 10 abilities or spells.  This skill may be purchased only once.

## Ritual Magic
>This skill allows the user to access the standard ritual magic library.  More information can be found in the Ritual Magic section.

## Tracking
>This skill is purchased once. Using this skill, the character can attempt to track a target's tracks. The target tracks are assigned a value according to weather, ground, recency, and skill of the target hiding their tracks. With all that taken in, the resulting modified track number is compared to the trackers number.
>
>Tracking can be combined with the survivalist knowledge skill to gain greater bonuses and be considered master tracker.
>
>When a player asks to track something/someone a marshal will determine if the tracking succeeds and how much information a player gets.  PCs cannot track other PCs.

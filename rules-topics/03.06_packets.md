# Spell / Arrow / Alchemy Packets

---
* There are no type = color requirements.  However, there is a strong preference for white, as they are far easier to find.
* Wet, torn, or damaged packets should be discarded rather than returned to the NPC Camp packet bucket.
* A packet can hit you anywhere and it counts (including clothing). Weapons that strike your head, groin, or a hand holding a weapon do not count.
* When creating packets, an ideal cut size for the fabric is between 4"x4" to 6"x6".
* The approximate amount of seed inside a packet is between 1/2 tbsp to 1 tbsp depending on the type of seed you use.  The resulting packet should not be so large that it cannot fit into a standard film canister (33 mm/ 1.3 inch).
* Do not use birdseed with sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.

### Packet Crafting Materials

* **Rubber bands**: Size #32-33 is preferred (1/8"). Must be natural rubber.
* **Birdseed**: Millet bird seed or bird seed that does **not** contain sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.

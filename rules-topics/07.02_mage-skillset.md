### School Initiation
This skill allows a character to be initiated into a school of magic, allowing them to allocate mana points to that school or memorize spells from that school each Rest. This skill may be purchased once for each school of magic (Arcane, Nature, Spirit).

### Mana Attunement
In order to cast a spell, a character must possess the appropriate School Initiation skill, and purchase ranks of Mana Attunement. Each purchase of Mana Attunement adds 10 Mana Points to the character's Mana Pool. Casting a spell will remove a number of Mana Points from their pool equal to the spell's level.

At each Rest (and before first coming into game), the character may distribute their Mana Points across each school for which they possess the School Initiation skill. Their allocation can only be changed once their Rest is completed. Once distributed, the character may cast the spells in that school on the fly, deducting the Mana Point cost of the spell from their points allocated to that school.

Characters may alternatively choose to explicitly memorize their spell list. Doing so grants a bonus 10% total Mana Points to be distributed. The character must mark down how many of which spells they have chosen to memorize, and they may then only cast those spells (until their next Rest).

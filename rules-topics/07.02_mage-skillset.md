## Primary Initiation  
This skill allows a character to be initiated into a school of magic, allowing them to allocate mana points to that school or memorize spells from that school each Rest. This skill may be purchased once for each school of magic (Arcane, Nature, Spirit).

## Secondary Initiation  
This skill allows a character to be initiated into a school of magic, allowing them to allocate mana points to that school or memorize spells from that school each Rest. This skill may be purchased once for each school of magic (Arcane, Nature, Spirit).

## Tertiary Initiation  
This skill allows a character to be initiated into a school of magic, allowing them to allocate mana points to that school or memorize spells from that school each Rest. This skill may be purchased once for each school of magic (Arcane, Nature, Spirit).

## Attunement  
Increases the characters Mana Pool by 10 points. Mana Points are expended to cast Spells. Mana Pool Points are refreshed upon a successful Rest.

## Blood Magic  
Blood Magic reduces a character's Mana Point cap to 25% of their maximum Mana Points (rounded down). However, Blood Mages are able replenish their Mana Points (up to their new maximum Mana Points) with the Exsanguinate ability. Blood Mages cannot use memorization, and are ineligble for the bonus Mana Points associated with it.

## Exsanguinate  
This allows a character to perform an exsanguination on a recently-dead corpse to increase their current Mana Points by 5. "Doing so requires a 3 count of 1 I exsanguinate, 2 I exsanguinate, 3 I exsanguinate". Upon completion, the character's current Mana Points are increased by 5. This does not allow a character to increase their current Mana Points above their maximum Mana Point cap. The target of this ability must be a creature that had a metabolism and is currently in its Death count. Note: Similar to Entrap Spirit, this ability may be used on the corpse of an NPC that did not wait to be searched, Entrapped, or Exsanguinated. Under these circumstances, the player must inform the mod marshal that they intend to use this ability on the mod, or immediately after its use.

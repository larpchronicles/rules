# Life & Death

## Body _(aka Health Points)_

---
Body is the measurement of a character's state of health, and is often referred to as "Health Points" or "Hit Points" in many RPG systems. All characters start with 10 Body, and gain more via the Toughness skill. Receiving any amount of Damage reduces your Current Body. You can receive healing effects to increase your Body after taking Damage, but healing may never put you above your Maximum Body.


## Alive

---
Any character with 1 or more Current Body is "**Alive**."


## Unconscious

---
A character whose Current Body is exactly 0 is considered **Unconscious**. A character who is Unconscious is unable to take any actions that require active thought or movement, and the character is considered helpless. Being **Unconscious** lasts for 1 minute, at the end of which time the character is returned to consciousness with 1 Body. If a character takes any additional damage while at 0 and **Unconscious**, they proceed to begin **Bleeding Out**.


## Bleeding Out (aka Dying)

---
A character who has their Current Body reduced to -1 is considered **Bleeding Out**. A character cannot be reduced to below -1 Body, regardless of the amount of damage taken.

**Bleeding Out** lasts for 1 minute, during which the character is unconscious and may not make any game actions that require consciousness. Any amount of healing will restore the character's Body by the amount stated by the healing effect, and they will no longer be **Bleeding Out**.

Receiving First Aid will pause the dying count until the First Aid is completed or the character performing the First Aid is interrupted, at which point the **Dying** character will either be at 0 body, **Unconscious**, or their **Bleeding Out** count will resume at its previous count.

After 1 minute of **Bleeding Out**, the character dies and is now **Dead**.

_(Ex: Bob is **Bleeding Out**. Thirty seconds into **Bleeding Out**, Charlie heals Bob for 10 body. Bob is now conscious, able to act again, and has 9 body.)_


## Dead

---
A character that goes 1 minute of **Bleeding Out** without receiving any healing or First Aid, or who is affected by some other Death effect, becomes **Dead**.

**Death lasts for 5 minutes**, at which point, the character's body dissipates, their spirit departs and travels to a **Shrine of Resurrection. **Any in-game items the character possesses when they dissipate are dropped to the ground, the player puts on a white headband and goes Out-Of-Game, and should seek out a marshal (either the marshal of the mod, or NPC camp) to seek resurrection.

While **Dead**, a character is not aware of their surroundings, and may not make any game actions, move, speak, be affected by any effect that reduces or heals Body Points, or be affected by any effect that does not specifically target **Dead** bodies.

During the 5 minutes the character is **Dead**, if they receive a Life spell or Revivify spell, they become **Alive** as per the spell they receive _(ie, Life will restore the character's Current Body to their Maximum Body, Revivify will restore the character to **Alive** but **Unconscious** at 0 body)_.


## Spirits

---
The spirit of a character is the essence of that person. Spirits are always Out Of Game, and may not interact with or be aware of the In-Game world, and In Game characters may only interact with spirits within a Shrine of Resurrection or while under an effect that explicitly states that they may do so.


## Resurrection

---
A character who has passed their 5 minute **Death** count dissipates, and their spirit will depart to seek **Resurrection**. If the spirit, as an Out-of-Game decision, believes that an ally may come and attempt to **Resurrect** them using the Rank IX Spirit Spell Resurrection, then they may linger for a time. If they do not, then the spirit will depart it's current location to seek the nearest safe **Shrine of Resurrection.** The knowledge of whether or not a specific Shrine is "Safe" is entirely OOG knowledge, but a Spirit will never **Resurrect** at an unsafe Shrine. When a Spirit **Resurrects**, they will accrue **Strain**, explained below.

Any player may choose to have their character dissipate at any time, for any reason, and then immediately seek resurrection.


## Strain

---
**Strain** is described as what happens when a spirit is pushed beyond its normal limits. For many, their Spirit will never incur any **Strain**, yet for Adventurers, **Strain** is an all-too-common occurrence. The most common way of acquiring strain is through the process of Resurrection. Whenever a character Resurrects, they gain Two points of **Strain** on their Spirit.

While a Spirit has any **Strain**, they are unable to incorporate new experiences, and as such, a character with **Strain** cannot spend any accumulated Skill Points until their **Strain** is reduced to 0. A Spirit recovers from **Strain** by experiencing new things. For every event a Character attends, they reduce any **Strain** on their Spirit by 1, including in an event where they Resurrect.

A few points of **Strain** can be carefully managed, but anyone who accrues too many should begin thinking of their own safety first. If at any point a Character should attempt to Resurrect with 10 or more points of **Strain** however, they fail to Resurrect, and are now **Permanently Dead**.


## Permanent Death

---
A character who is **Permanently Dead** may no longer be returned to life by any means. The Player of a **Permanently Dead** character may then roll 50% of the accumulated SP of the **Permanently Dead** character into a new Character, plus the base 100 SP for a new character.


## Killing Blow

---
Killing Blow is a 3-count that can be interrupted. When Killing Blowed, the target becomes **Dead**. _Killing Blow 1, Killing Blow 2, Killing Blow 3 &lt;type>_.  The target of a killing blow may refuse it, so long as they are capable of movement.  Any killing blow is assumed to automatically be refused by a target capable of movement, unless explicitly accepted by the target.


## Dismemberment & Body Smuggling

---
A character whose body has been dismembered while **Bleeding Out  or Dead** may still be healed or revived. The part of the character that can be so affected is represented by and located wherever the player of that character is. The spirit-containing body of a character may be carried by another character, however, the person carrying the body may not run or move faster than the player of the character being carried.

Dismembering a character for the purpose of attempting to use a smaller body part to heal, revive, or even hide the character is not any different than if the character were not dismembered. If a character is **Bleeding Out **or** Dead **and someone wishes to bring that character to a healer, or move the body away from where it fell, they may role-play carrying the body by picking it up on a three count _(ex: "One I pick you up… Two I pick you up… Three I pick you up…")_ and carrying it elsewhere. The carrying player may not run, and both players must roleplay maintaining contact and remain within arm's reach of each other. If any effect would forcibly move the carrier away at a pace faster than a walk, or would otherwise render them unable to hold game items in their hands, the character must drop the body on a One Count _(ex: "One I drop you")_ and may only resume carrying them on a new three count.

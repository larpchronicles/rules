# Chronicles Game Rules

## Introduction

---
Oh hi, welcome to Chronicles!  We hope you are ready to make friends that you will not soon be rid of.  Before getting too far into this rulebook, take a deep breath.  This rulebook is long, packed full of information, and there is a lot to absorb.  It can be overwhelming all at once.  Take it in sections and ask all the questions!  PS - Don't forget to exhale.

In the next section, there are tips and brief overviews that are aimed to help prepare a new player for their first Chronicles event.  Still have questions after reading a bit?  No matter a player's LARPing experience or lack thereof, our staff and players alike are very helpful and always seek to help answer questions for anyone and everyone.  Most of us can be readily found on our discord:  http://larpchronicles.com/discord

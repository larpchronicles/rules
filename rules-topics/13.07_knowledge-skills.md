# Knowledge Skills

>Knowledge skills are a way through which characters can gather information about the world around them. These skills are gained automatically as a character gains SP, choosing a Profession and Hobby, with their Profession being your "main focus" and scaling faster. Once they have capped a Profession or Hobby at Rank 10, they may select a new one immediately to begin scaling, and it starts with 1 rank. A Profession goes up in rank every 50 SP, and each Hobby goes up in rank every 100 SP. So they will unlock their second Profession at 450 SP, and both theirr Second Hobby and Third Profession at 900 SP, and so on. Each knowledge skill represents a specific area of expertise that a character can improve upon. These skills might be utilized when interacting with Plot to help tje, discover more information about what is happening during a particular scene, or Plot may choose to ask for Knowledge skills leading into an adventure to help flesh out what the characters might have discovered.

>Generally, any piece of information that a player will attempt to discover will be assigned a secret "Difficulty Class" by the Plot member, on a scaling slide of 1 through 10. A Difficulty Class of 1 would represent fairly common knowledge, something that most anyone who cares about the subject would know. A 10 on the other hand would represent particularly unusual or rare information, something that only a true expert in the field would have discovered. If they have enough ranks in the chosen skill to meet the difficulty class, they may learn some useful information. Having less than the set Difficulty may result in incomplete or slightly misleading information, while having more ranks than the required Difficulty may result in getting more detailed or extra information.

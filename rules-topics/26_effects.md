# Effects

## Effect Sources

---
Sources of the effects below include Monster Abilities, Production, Martial Skills, and Magical Spells.

## Removing Effects

---
The Life spell will remove any ongoing effects of the target's choice.

Dispel Magic and Nullify Spell work on all effects with a magical source unless otherwise specified.

## Visible Effects

---
If a term is denoted as visible, it is something the character is permitted to respond with if a player asks "What do I see?"

If a player is in an unconscious state (Bleeding Out, Sleep, Dead, etc.) and they are asked "What do I see?" the proper response is "Properly Phys-repped", "Recognizable as [Individual]", "[Race] as I appear" etc.  The response should not include what state the player is in.

## Effect Clarifications

---
### Curse of Transformation
* Curse of Transformation (CoT) makes the target immune to CoT, meaning the effect does not stack.
* Any character or NPC created by CoT is not capable of inflicting CoT on another character. The only time this is not true is for very specific and limited plot reasons.
* There are three types of CoT: Ones that go away on death, ones that go away on resurrection, and ones that go away only with ritual. All COTs may be removed by ritual.
 * If the character is CoT into a skeleton (think like a Greater version of Create Undead), that'll probably go away on death.
 * If the character is CoT into a Vampire, that might go away on Resurrection.
 * If the character is CoT into a Plot device, that might require a ritual.

### Entrapment Clarification
The Entrapment spell allows a caster the chance to capture the spirit of a target. Entrapment works on ANY creature that matches the following:
* Must have human-like intelligence.
* Must be alive.
* Must have a spirit that is **NOT** protected by a SPIRIT BOTTLE effect.
* Must not crumble at 0 body.

### Shattering & Destroying
Shattering or destroying containers that contain things does NOT affect the items within it.

### Skillless Clarification
Skilless refers to any abilities purchased with Skill Points. A character does not lose any armor or body gained from purchased skills.

**Physical description characteristics of Curse of Transformations and Transforms are not always uniquely identifiable, and cannot be used to reliably ascertain the presence of a Curse of Transformation.
For instance,  there are many creatures that have fangs, so a "fanged humanoid" is not necessarily a vampire

***Enslavement can be identified by using a Break Enslavement Rune.

# Garb
Continued participation in Chronicles will require a costume for a character that draws on fantasy and historical influences. A costume helps with being a part of the world, allows for the expression of aspects of a character, and contributes towards the effort to create an experience that feels like an otherworldly adventure. Wearing garb saves mundane clothes from getting damaged or dirty and can serve as an additional indicator for whether the player's character is present or the player is NPCing.

While garb need not be constructed with historical techniques and materials -- nobody is going to throw a fit over polyester blends -- efforts should be taken to escape the modern "jeans & t-shirt" silhouette. Fellow players can help create or find suitable elements.  Costuming is sort of a journey all players are consistently on.

Beyond that, jewelry and pouches are just a few other accessories that create endless opportunities for character expression. While adding to garb/costume, players need to make certain that they do not have anything that endangers them or others.  e.g. Glass vials are neat, but when they break they become hazards that must be properly disposed of.  Dangling hoop earrings may suit a character, but they could be snagged by a weapon and pulled.

A Note on Disguises:  PCs will always recognize PCs despite disguises.

# NPC-Garb
Those who are NPCing often wear tabards that allude to what they are playing. It may be hard to tell what is going on in the dark. A player can always wear their headband and ask, "Are you there?/ Are you in game?" or as their character, ask, "Who goes there?"	If an answer is given without full information, the PC has the option to move & inspect them closer at their own peril and asking, "What do I see?"

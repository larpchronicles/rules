## Initiation, Specialization, and Attunement
| Magic Skill Costs  | F  | T | R | M |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| School Initiation  | 5+5 | 3+4 | 5+5  | 3+1 |
| School Specialization | 20 | 15  | 20 | 10  |
| Mana Attunement | 10+10 | 3+4 | 10+8 | 3+1 |

### School Initiation
This skill allows a character to be initiated into a school of magic, allowing them to allocate mana points to that school or memorize spells from that school each Rest. This skill may be purchased once for each school of magic (Arcane, Nature, Spirit).  

### School Specialization
When purchased, the character must specify which school they have mastery over. This skill allows that character to use their Mana Points to cast Level 10 spells of the chosen school. This skill may be purchased only once.

### Mana Attunement
In order to cast a spell, a character must possess the appropriate School Initiation skill, and purchase ranks of Mana Attunement. Each purchase of Mana Attunement adds 10 Mana Points to the character's Mana Pool. Casting a spell will remove a number of Mana Points from their pool equal to the spells level.

At each Rest (and before first coming into game), the character may distribute their Mana Points across each school for which they possess the School Initiation skill. Their allocation can only be changed once their Rest is completed. Once distributed, the character may cast the spells in that school on the fly, deducting the Mana Point cost of the spell from their points allocated to that school.

Characters may alternatively choose to explicitly memorize their spell list. Doing so grants a bonus 10% total Mana Points to be distributed. The character must mark down how many of which spells they have chosen to memorize, and they may then only cast those spells (until their next Rest).

| **Incant**  | "By the spirits, I force this minion to rise and serve." |
| **Description** |  This spell will temporarily animate a corpse that has not yet dissipated, binding the target's spirit to its corpse and pausing its five minute death count. Upon the ending of this effect, the target shall resume their death count from the point at which this effect paused it. The target will remember its actions and the events it observes during the duration of this effect. The target is considered a Minor Undead, and is obviously recognizable as _Undead <Character Name>_, or _Undead &lt;Character Race>_. The target will follow simple commands given by the caster, including speaking a phrase, moving, and using skills. If commanded to speak, the target may only repeat phrases given to it by the caster. The target cannot be compelled to reveal secret information, and it cannot be compelled to take action requiring secret information. _(Ex: the target cannot be commanded to speak the combination to its secret safe, nor can it be commanded to unlock its secret safe.)_ By default, if the target is not given any commands, the target will not speak and simply follow the caster and attack anything that attacks the caster. This is an ANIMATE effect and causes an UNDEAD effect. |

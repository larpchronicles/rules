# Chronicles Game Rules

## Introduction

---
Oh hi, welcome to Chronicles!  We hope you're ready to make friends that you won't soon be rid of.  Before getting too far into this rulebook, take a deep breath.  This rulebook is long, it is dense, and there is a lot to absorb.  It can be daunting, overwhelming even.  Don't forget to exhale.

In this section, there are tips and brief overviews that are aimed to help prepare a new player for their first Chronicles event.  Still have questions after reading a bit?  No matter a player's LARPing experience or lack thereof, our staff and players alike are very helpful and always seek to help answer questions for anyone and everyone.  Most of us can be readily found on our discord:  http://larpchronicles.com/discord

## Game Setting

---

Chronicles is a sword & sorcery fantasy game set in a pre-industrial world called Evren.  Our chapter primarily centers around the port town of Varos within the Kingdom of the Terran Valley.  Adventurers from all over this world -- and a former world named Tyra -- meet in Varos for the market faires.

## Quick-Start For New Players

---
If they have not before reaching this section, new players are sure to hear plenty of words or acronyms used that they may be unclear on as tot he meaning -- or at least the meaning of them for Chronciles.  Below is a short list of those someone will likely hear.  A longer glossary is available further in the rulebook.

|Term|Meaning|Explanation|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Body|Numerical value representative of a character's health.|Also sometimes referred to as health or hit points.|
|Boffer|A weapon physical representation.|Also referred to as "claws" or "bites" depending on length.  These are simple weapon reps.|
|GP|Goblin Points|The name of points given to players in exchange for volunteering or donating their time and/or money.|
|IBGA|In Between Game Actions|This is a heads up email sent to plot at least a week prior to the next event that gives them an idea of what a player's character worked on "off board".  It is a good option for things that do not need back and forth such as research, sending a letter, or a boring thing a player does not want to do at game. |
|IC/IG|In Character/In Game|Refers to things that are happening in the game.|
|Metagaming|Players choosing to use out of character knowledge as their characters.|This is when a character knows things they did not actually learn in game and either communicates it to others or modifies their behavior against their normal behavior or in response to the OOC knowledge.|
|Mod|Module|This is an event during game where plot will run pieces of storyline for players to interact with.|
|NPC|Non-Player Character|This is either plot or a player volunteering time and is either going to be a character or a mob.|
|OOG/OOC|Out of Game/ Out of Character.|Separating a player's knowledge from their character's knowledge is a hard practiced skill.  Most players actively avoid engaging in metagaming, but there are good forms of metagaming, such as ensuring others get involved.|
|PC|Player Character|This is often used to refer to the players, but in general it refers the character a player is portraying.|
|Phys Rep|Physical representation|Also referred to as "rep".  Term for any weapon, shield, armor, or item prop.|
|Retcon|Revising words or actions.|Retconning is announced on an out of game level and refers to when a player wishes to "take back" character's actions or words.  Most often, this is done because of an out of game misunderstanding.|
|RP|Roleplay|Roleplay refers to actions, emotes, or words that are considered to be performed not by the player, but by a character.|
|SP|Skill Points|Points that accrue over a number of events a player attend that can be used to purchase or improve skills.|

## New Player Guide

---
Welcome to Chronicles. Whether you've been LARPing for years, or have never seen a tabard in your life, Chronicles welcomes you. For the newer players, here are a few tips to get you started!

### Creating a Character
All new players start with 100 Skill Points (SP), 10 body, and 5 armor.  <i>Body is the term used for a character's health or hit points.</i>  The 5 armor is considered a free bonus as long as the player is wearing garb or a costume.  Skill Points are used to purchase skills like the ability to swing a sword or cast a spell.  Players can use the Character Calculator to design their character.  
* All characters earn 3 Skill Points per day of an event.
* Characters under 200 Build gain Skill Points at 2x the rate.
* Players can accrue up to 1 extra Skill Point per day by working a NPC shift (See the sections on NPC and Goblin Points for more details).
* All characters under 200 build can be recreated or rewritten without requiring a Spirit Forge. <i>A Spirit Forge is an advanced ritual that allows a player to change their character's class and skill point purchases.</i>  If done during an event, a member of staff or plot must sign the new or modified character sheet.

Have a character in another LARP system and want to transfer it to Chronicles?  Please see our Transfer Policy!

### Secondary Characters 
Once a player hits 200 Skill Points, they may create a secondary character.  This character will always have 75 percent of the primary character's SP.  All characters beyond the second character will have 50 percent of the primary character's SP.  No matter what character is played, all gained SP will be applied to the primary character.  Aside from SP, everything is tracked separately for each character (strain, ritual effects, items, etc).

Example:
> Jim has 275 SP.  His primary character has 275 SP. His seconary character has 206 SP.  His third/fourth/fifth/etc character has 137 SP.
> Jim attends a 2 day event and gains 6 SP.  His primary character now has 281 SP.  His secondary character has 75% of this, and now has 210 SP.  His third/fourth/fifth/etc character has 140 SP.

### Identify Ability
Allows the character to Identify an item, a group of items, or target after 1 minute of concentration and continuous contact. This will make the nature and workings of enchantments on an item/creature known to the character, at the discretion of plot. There may be some properties that still remain hidden to the character.

Status that require Identify:
|Identify Needed|
|:---:|
|Animate|
|Curse|
|Curse of Transformation|
|Infect|
|Spirit Bottle|

### Floating Reset
Some skills or abilities are listed as "Daily".  These skills and abilities are renewed between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.  If a player is on a module (an event during game run by plot) between that time frame, they must attempt the reset immediately after it ends.  Daily skills and abilities require 10 minutes of concentration/rest to refresh.  <i>Concentration consists of being silent, not using skills or items, not running, and typically maintaining physical contact with something. Rest refers to a period of time in which a player does not use abilities or run.  This is done to reset expended abilities or skills.  More information about rest can be found in the Resting section.</i>

### How Does Combat Work
Chronicles is a boffer combat LARP that focuses as much on roleplay and interaction between PCs and NPCs as physical combat.  The goal of combat is for all participants and observers to be safe.  We emphasize light combat.  A general rule is, if a player's swing is enough to hurt, someone, they are probably swinging too hard.  While accidents may happen, someone is more likely to twist an ankle on uneven ground than hurt themselves during combat.  More details can be found in the Combat section of the rulebook.

### Plot Members and Marshals
Plot members and marshals are part of the staff of Chronicles.  The plot team serves the same function as a game master does in a tabletop role playing game (RPG).  During an event, the plot team works from the building identified as NPC Camp or Logistics. They will give rulings, run a mod, observe a ritual, and other out of game (OOG) tasks that are needed throughout a market faire.  If a player has a question on a rule or how something works, they will need to ask the appropriate marshal.  
Plot Member – A member of the group of people who work together to keep the game moving, adjudicate rules, run mods, and many other roles essential to the game.  In tabletop terms, they are essentially the game master or dungeon master.

Mod Marshal – A person who runs a mod for a group for PCs.  They will set the stage giving descriptions, locations, etc. Should any rule questions or disputes come up, the marshal has final say.  If a player believes the marshal made an incorrect call, they may bring it up with the marshal or a member of plot after the mod, when it does not disrupt the flow of the game.

Ritual Marshal – A person who oversees a player character (PC) perform ritual magic.  They will ensure all factors of the ritual are performed by the PCs and determine if the ritual is a success or failure.  More complex rituals will require a full plot member.

Rogue Marshal – If a character wishes to steal from someone's cabin, the player must have a rogue marshal present.  This marshal ensures that personal property is not taken, and that the would-be thief follows all rules of the game (lockpicking chests, recognizing circles of power, etc.)  Entering a cabin with intent to steal without a rogue marshal can have severe consequences including referring the person to the local police for theft or breaking and entering.

### How to Become A Ritual Marshal
To become a ritual marshal, a player will need to volunteer with the head of the plot team.  The head of plot will ensure that the player knows the ritual rules and have the player marshal some rituals with a plot member.  Once the player has proven themselves, they can become a ritual marshal. 

### What should I bring to my first events?
Chronicles often has spare equipment to loan to newer players. That being said, beyond LARP-specific items, there are several things that any player should bring.
* Plain Clothes
* Comfortable Footwear
* Water Bottle/Canteen
* Notebook and Writing Utensil
* Hand Fan, Sunscreen, Bug spray
* Light

**Plain Clothes**
If a player is new and does not have lots of fancy LARP clothing yet, they do not need to worry!  A solid colored shirt and pants work just fine as starter clothes. Cargo pants (or similar) are great for early events due to the extra pockets. For shirts, a simple t-shirt, button up, or sweatshirt work fine. The most important part is that any clothing used does not have large graphics or logos on them.

**Comfortable Footwear**
Chronicles generally involves at least a moderate amount of walking. Therefor, comfortable footwear and socks are highly important. It is always recommended to make sure footwear is comfortable rather than just stylish. Extra socks are just as important. Especially if it is damp or rain is predicted. 

**Water Bottle**
Especially important when it is hot out, but always useful. Chronicles generally has drinks, including water, on site, but sometimes a player finds themselves far away from the places they are stored. Having a portable source of liquid is incredibly useful for long mods.

**Notebook and Writing Utensil**
Notes are incredibly useful, both for in and out of game information. Many places sell notepads small enough to fit in a pocket. That plus some pens or pencils is a very cheap way to keep track of information.

**Hand Fan, Sunscreen, Bug Spray**
Chronicles is primarily an outdoors event. That means heat, sun, insects, water, and everything else. Simple things that are taken on any outdoor trip, like a fan, sunscreen, and bug spray, can help make an event significantly more enjoyable.  

Allergic to DDT or prefer something more natural?  Be sure to test for allergic reactions before utilizing:  An effective repellant can be made by diluting rosemary essential oil with water.  About 10 drops per 1-2oz of water in a spray bottle.

**Light**
This one is more personal preference. Some people prefer to bring a light source to events. In most cases, this is a low-lumen flashlight or LED lantern. In all cases, the light needs to be dim enough to not blind other players. Usually this is done by covering the light in layers of cloth, commonly held on with rubber bands or hair ties, to dim it down.  Red lights and stargazing flashlights also work, although some may still need dimming.  If a brighter light is needed or about to be in use, it is generally polite to warn other players before turning it on, so they are prepared.

## What should I expect at an event?
Chronicles is a fantasy LARP. This means lots of swords, sorcery, and exotic races.  Game takes place from Friday evening through Sunday morning for a two day event and Friday evening through Monday morning for a three day event.

Typical progression for a two day event:
* **Friday**: Game begins on Friday evening. Site opens around 5 pm. Players check in with staff, find their beds, and get into costume. Check in may last until 10-11pm. Following check in, PC Talk is held, typically in a building identified as the tavern.  PC Talk is where plot & staff review important information for the event.  PC Talk completes with a communicated Lay On time.  Lay On is when the game officially starts.
* **Saturday**: Most of the gaming takes place on Saturday, and people can usually find something to do.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served on Saturday too. Any players with dietary restrictions or allergies should alert staff during pre-registration or check in.
* **Sunday**: Gaming typically goes into early Sunday morning and usually wraps up between 2-4am.  Sunday is also when people pack up, complete checkout, clean up the site, and depart. Generally, people try to have everything done by noon.

**Important Locations**
The exact physical locations of these vary by campsite, although they are usually pointed out during PC Talk.
* **Cabins (In Game)**: Where players sleep and store in game and out of game items not currently in use. If possible, out of game items are best stored under the beds or in a marked container to avoid confusion.
* **Tavern (In Game)**: The main in-game building. This is where most people gather between activities/mods and where both friendly and hostile Non-Player Characters (NPCs) tend to gather. It is also where meals are served and where snacks and drinks can be bought.
* **NPC Camp/Logistics (Out Of Game)**: NPC Camp or Logistics is where the plot team is located when they are not out running mods or playing NPCs. The building is considered out of game (OOG), although it may occasionally be used to run non-combat mods. It also usually has a whiteboard that players may add their name and a small note to in order to request a mod.  This allows the plot team to know what specific activities to run.  As this is a building used by plot and staff and there may be on-going discussions concerning a storyline, please make sure to knock before entering.
* **Plot Cabin (Out Of Game)**: Where plot, full time NPCs (volunteers that assist plot for the full event), and sometimes staff sleep and store their personal belongings.  This building is considered OOG.  Like NPC Camp, it may occasionally be used to run non-combat mods.

**General Advice**
Do not be afraid to ask questions.  Even in the middle of combat or intense role playing, do not be afraid to ask what something does or means.  There are also many people with a decent grasp on the rules who can answer questions.  In game, asking questions is just as useful, although it may not always yield answers.

Remember, it is a game. We are all here to have fun and in general, people do not want to be rude or mean to others.  Try not to let any in-game interactions affect personal OOG opinions of the person behind the character.  In roleplay, many people act in ways they never would in real life!  That is one of the joys of the event.  It is not personal.  They do not hate the player, just the character.  

However, sometimes, a player may find themselves with the perception that something negative occured due to an OOG reason, may feel themselves becoming frustrated, or experienced something that they find disruptively upsetting.  In these situations and all like it, please never hestitate to approach staff about it or go out of game for a while.

### Game Atmosphere
Chronicles science, medicine, and technology is roughly in the 14th century (middle ages).  For roleplay, players are encouraged to act, speak, and behave as if they exist in that time frame.  We do of course allow players to use modern medicine but if possible, it should be done away from a large crowd to promote the in game atmosphere.

**Religion**
There are beings known as gods in Chronicles, but how a character views or engages with them is up to the individual player.  No character is required to worship a god.

We strive to be inclusive and respectful at Chronicles and do not want anyone to be in the situation of giving offense to others.  Players are disallowed from using real world religious symbols or iconography with their costuming, garb, or props.  Similarly, in roleplay, players should also avoid use of or invocations of gods, demons, or other recognizable figures of real world religious or spiritual importance.

**Politics** 
In game politics are part of life. Whether a character wishes to serve the king loyally, ignore his command, or attempt a rebellion is up to them!  Just know that there may be in-game consequences for a character's actions.  As with religion, it is best to not use any recognizable OOG political symbols, since politics can be an anachronistic and fiery topic. 
It is also best to not talk about OOG politics during game.

# Chronicles Game Rules

## Introduction

---
Oh hi, welcome to Chronicles!  We hope you're ready to make friends that you won't soon be rid of.  Before you get too far into this rulebook, take a deep breath.  This rulebook is long, it's dense, and there is a lot to absorb.  It can be daunting, overwhelming even.  Don't forget to exhale.

In this section, you will find tips, and brief overviews that are aimed to help prepare you for your first Chronicles event.  Do you still have questions?  No matter your LARPing experience or lack thereof, our staff and players alike are very helpful and always seek to help answer questions for anyone and everyone.  If you are not already, you can find most of us on discord:  http://larpchronicles.com/discord

## Game Setting

---

Chronicles is a sword & sorcery fantasy game set in a pre-industrial world called Evren.  Our chapter primarily centers around the port town of Varos within the Kingdom of the Terran Valley.  Adventurers from all over this world -- and a former world named Tyra -- meet in Varos for the market faires.

## Quick-Start For New Players

---
If you haven't yet, you are sure to hear plenty of words or acronyms that you're unsure of the meaning -- or at least how we use it.  Below is a short list of ones you will likely hear.  There is a longer glossary further in the rulebook.

|Term|Meaning|Explanation|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Boffer|A weapon physical representation.|Also referred to as "claws" or "bites" depending on length.  These are simple weapon reps.|
|GP|Goblin Points|The name of points given to players in exchange for volunteering or donating their time and/or money.|
|IBGA|In Between Game Actions|This is a heads up email sent to plot at least a week prior to the next event that gives them an idea of what your character worked on "off board".  It's a good option for things that do not need back and forth such as research, sending a letter, or a boring thing you don't want to do at game. |
|IC|In Character| Refers to things that are happening in the game.|
|Metagaming|Players choosing to use OOC knowledge as their characters.|This is when a character knows things they did not actually learn in game and either communicates it to others or modifies their behavior against their normal behavior or in response to the OOC knowledge.|
|Mod|Module|This is an event during game where plot will run pieces of storyline for players to interact with.|
|NPC|Non-Player Character|This is either plot or a player volunteering time and is either going to be a character or a mob.|
|OOG/OOC|Out of Game/ Out of Character.|Separating your knowledge from your character's knowledge is a hard practiced skill.  Most of us actively avoid engaging in metagaming, but there are good forms of metagaming, such as ensuring others get involved.|
|PC|Player Character|This is often used to refer to the players, but in general it refers the character a player is portraying.|
|Phys Rep|Physical representation|Term for any weapon, shield, armor, or item prop.|
|Retcon|Revising words or actions.|Retconning is announced on an OOC level and refers to when a player wishes to "take back" character's actions or words.  Most often, this is done because of an OOC misunderstanding.|
|RP|Roleplay|Roleplay refers to actions, emotes, or words that are performed not by the player, but by a character.|
|SP|Skill Points|Points that accrue over a number of events you attend that can be used to purchase or improve skills.|

## New Player Guide

--
Welcome to Chronicles. Whether you've been LARPing for years, or have never seen a
tabard in your life, Chronicles welcomes you. For the newer players, here are a few tips
to get you started

### What should I bring to my first events?
Chronicles often has spare equipment to loan to newer players. That being said, beyond LARP-specific items, there are several things that you can bring.
* Plain Clothes
* Comfortable Footwear
* Water Bottle/Canteen
* Notebook and Writing Utensil
* Hand Fan, Sunscreen, Bug spray
* Light

**Plain Clothes**

  If you're new, and don't have lots of fancy LARP clothing yet, don't worry. A solid colored shirt and pants work just fine as starter clothes. Cargo pants (or similar) are great for early events due to the extra pockets. For shirts, a simple t-shirt, button up, or sweat shirt work fine. The most important part is that they don't have large graphics or logos on them.

**Comfortable Footwear**

  Chronicles generally involves at least a moderate amount of walking. Therefor, comfortable footwear and socks are highly important. It is always recommended to make sure your footwear is comfortable rather than just stylish. Extra socks are just as important. Especially if it's damp or rain is predicted. Water Bottle: Especially important when it's hot out, but always useful. Chronicles generally has drinks, including water, on site, but sometimes you find yourself away from the places it's stored. Having a portable source of liquid is incredibly useful for long mods.

**Notebook and Writing Utensil**

Notes are incredibly useful, both for in and out of game information. Many places sell notepads small enough to fit in a pocket. That plus some pens or pencils is a very cheap way to keep track of information. Hand Fan, Sunscreen, Bug Spray: Chronicles is primarily an outdoors event. That means heat, sun, insects, water, and everything else. Simple things that you'd take on any outdoor trip, like a fan, sunscreen, and bug spray, can help make an event significantly more enjoyable.

**Light**

This one is more personal preference. Some people prefer to bring a light source to events. In most cases, this is a flashlight or LED lantern. In all cases, the light needs to be dim enough to not blind other players. Usually this is done by covering the light in layers of cloth, commonly held on with rubber bands or hair ties, to dim it down.  Red lights and stargazing flashlights also work, although some may still need dimming.  If you need a brighter light, it's generally polite to warn other players before you turn it on so they are prepared.

## What should I expect at an event?

Chronicles is a fantasy LARP. This means lots of swords, sorcery, and exotic races.
Game takes place from Friday evening through Sunday morning.

* **Friday**: Game begins on Friday evening. Site opens around 5 pm. Players check in with staff, find their beds, and get into costume. Friday is also when PC Talk happens, where staff goes over important information for the event. Lay On, when the game starts, is normally called not long after.
* **Saturday**: Most of the gaming takes place on Saturday, and people can usually find something to do. Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner are served on Saturday too. Let staff know if you have any dietary restrictions.
* **Sunday**: Gaming typically goes into early Sunday morning. Sunday is also when people pack up, clean up site, and depart. Generally, people try to have everything done by noon.

**Important Locations**

The exact physical locations of these vary by camp site, although they are usually pointed out during PC talk.
* **Cabins (In Game)**: Where players sleep and store in game and out of game items not currently in use. If possible, out of game items are best stored under the beds, or in a marked container, to avoid confusion.
* **Tavern (In Game)**: The main in game building. This is where most people gather between activities, and where NPCs tend to gather, both friendly and hostile. It is also where meals are stored, and where snacks and drinks can be bought.
* **NPC Camp/Plot Cabin (Out Of Game)**: This is where Staff is located when they're not out running things or playing NPCs. The building is generally out of game, although it may occasionally be used to run non combat mods. It also usually has a board to note mods you want to do, so plot knows what people have planned. As this is a building used by staff, please make sure you knock before entering.

**General Advice**

Don't be afraid to ask questions. Even in the middle of combat or intense role playing, don't be afraid to ask what something does or means. There are also many people with a decent grasp on the rules who can answer questions. In game, asking questions is just as useful, although may not always get you answers.

It's just a game. We're all here to have fun. Try not to let any in game interactions affect your opinions of a person. Many people act in ways that they never would in real life. That's the joy of the event. It's not personal, they don't hate you, just your character. However, if you believe anything negative is being done out of game, or feel yourself getting frustrated, don't hesitate to talk to staff, or go out of game for a while to collect yourself.

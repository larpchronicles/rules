# Chronicles Game Rules (v2.7.4)

## Introduction

---
Oh hi, welcome to Chronicles!  We hope you're ready to make friends that you won't soon be rid of.  Before you get too far into this rulebook, take a deep breath.  This rulebook is long, it's dense, and there is a lot to absorb.  It can be daunting, overwhelming even.  Don't forget to exhale.

In this section, you will find tips, and brief overviews that are aimed to help prepare you for your first Chronicles event.  Do you still have questions?  No matter your LARPing experience or lack thereof, our staff and players alike are very helpful and always seek to help answer questions for anyone and everyone.  If you are not already, you can find most of us on discord:  http://larpchronicles.com/discord

## Game Setting

---

Chronicles is a sword & sorcery fantasy game set in a pre-industrial world called Evren.  Our chapter primarily centers around the port town of Varos within the Kingdom of the Terran Valley.  Adventurers from all over this world -- and a former world named Tyra -- meet in Varos for the market faires.

## Quick-Start For New Players

---
If you haven't yet, you are sure to hear plenty of words or acronyms that you're unsure of the meaning -- or at least how we use it.  Below is a short list of ones you will likely hear.  There is a longer glossary further in the rulebook.

|Term|Meaning|Explanation|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Boffer|A weapon physical representation.|Also referred to as "claws" or "bites" depending on length.  These are simple weapon reps.|
|GP|Goblin Points|The name of points given to players in exchange for volunteering or donating their time and/or money.|
|IBGA|In Between Game Actions|This is a heads up email sent to plot at least a week prior to the next event that gives them an idea of what your character worked on "off board".  It's a good option for things that do not need back and forth such as research, sending a letter, or a boring thing you don't want to do at game. |
|IC|In Character| Refers to things that are happening in the game.|
|Metagaming|Players choosing to use OOC knowledge as their characters.|This is when a character knows things they did not actually learn in game and either communicates it to others or modifies their behavior against their normal behavior or in response to the OOC knowledge.|
|Mod|Module|This is an event during game where plot will run pieces of storyline for players to interact with.|
|NPC|Non-Player Character|This is either plot or a player volunteering time and is either going to be a character or a mob.|
|OOG/OOC|Out of Game/ Out of Character.|Separating your knowledge from your character's knowledge is a hard practiced skill.  Most of us actively avoid engaging in metagaming, but there are good forms of metagaming, such as ensuring others get involved.|
|PC|Player Character|This is often used to refer to the players, but in general it refers the character a player is portraying.|
|Phys Rep|Physical representation|Term for any weapon, shield, armor, or item prop.|
|Retcon|Revising words or actions.|Retconning is announced on an OOC level and refers to when a player wishes to "take back" character's actions or words.  Most often, this is done because of an OOC misunderstanding.|
|RP|Roleplay|Roleplay refers to actions, emotes, or words that are performed not by the player, but by a character.|
|SP|Skill Points|Points that accrue over a number of events you attend that can be used to purchase or improve skills.|

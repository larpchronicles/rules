# Equipment 

## Weapon Construction
All weapons must have at least 5/8" of closed cell foam (ie, pipe foam, crosslinked EVA foam, etc.) completely covering the striking surface.

Thrusting tips must be at least 2" of open cell foam, and the core of the weapon must not be able to be felt through the thrusting tip. Weapons that do not have an open cell foam thrusting cannot be used to thrust or jab!

All weapons must have a closed cell foam pommel that completely envelopes the pommel end of the weapon core. This can be pipe foam, EVA foam, a foam fishing butt cap, or similar.

## Weapon Crafting Materials
* Ultralight Cores of carbon fiber, kitespar tube, fiberglass tube, or wrapped graphite tube.  Aluminum cores may only be used for polearms.  Diameter should be between .414-.610".
* Closed Cell Foam.  This can be pipe foam insulation and pool noodles and is used to pad the "blade" of a boffer.  It should have a wall at least 5/8" thick.
* Open Cell Foam.  Used for boffer tips, this is a less dense foam commonly found in fabric stores as fill for pillows or in hardware stores as pipe foam.
* Kite Tape or nylon rip stop repair tape.  Preferred vendor - [FunWithWind](https://funwithwind.com/store/ListCategoriesAndProducts2.asp?idCategory=186&idparent=171)

## Weapon Crafters
We have some players that make weapons that will sometimes coordinate with others to custom make something.  Asking in [Discord](http://larpchronicles.com/discord) is a good place to start if you would like to go this route.

A few online storefronts will have ready-made things, but please do ask others here about these places because some vendors have material and design types you will want to avoid if you want to pass weapons safety checks for most LARPs.

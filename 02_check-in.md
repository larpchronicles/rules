# Headband Rules

## Orange Headbands - Non Combatants & Pages
Pages are people that are unable to enter combat.  They may be children or adults, although any child under age 14 must be a Page.  Pages may not use combat skills, weapons, or throw packets.

**You may not ever physically strike a Page.**  If you engage in combat with a page, you may point your weapon or packet and say, "Page, I kill you."  They cannot participate in combat.  They are treated as if they have 1 health point/body.

## White Headbands - Out of Game
Once you arrive on site, you are entering an In Game Area.  If you are not in game as your character yet, you must have a white headband on.  If you do not have a white headband, you may request one from the Plot Team or Staff.  If there are none available, you may signify your out of game status by holding a hand to your forehead or touching the top of your head with a held item.  This gesture is accepted as an out of character signal and frequently used by NPCs when not in game.

If you are in game, you should not react or speak to anyone that is wearing a white headband without first going out of game yourself.  It is generally seen as poor etiquette to break the environment for others.

When your character dies and your dying count has expired, after dropping all in game items, you should put on a white headband and go to Logistics/NPC Camp to register your death.  Your spirit cannot interact in any manner with others.


# Hold & Medic Calls

If you hear anyone call "Hold" or "Medic" you must immediately stop all activity, movement, and be silent unless directed otherwise.  If you are physically able to, drop to one knee.  **These calls indicate an Out of Game emergency.**

Only the persons who have been identified as a Medic by the Plot Team or Staff should respond to the call of "Medic."  A Medic is an individual with CPR and/or First Aid certification or has a license to practice medicine.

Please do not call "Hold" or "Medic" unless you or someone else is injured in real life.


# In Game vs. Out of Game Areas & Combat

Out of Game Areas are areas that you are not permitted to engage in combat in.  You may not chase PCs or NPCs into these areas nor use these areas to hide from In Game events, NPCs, etc.

Bathrooms, showers, and Logistics/NPC Camp are considered Out of Game Areas.

**No-Combat Areas**
>Camp Eastman
>
> The kitchen, stairwell, and second floor of the Lodge are considered In Game, but combat is disallowed.
>
> The kitchen in the dining hall (tavern) is also considered In Game and combat is disallowed in this area.

Unless otherwise noted by the Plot Team or Staff, all other areas are considered In Game.


# General Etiquette

Help ensure we can return to these sites for future events by being respectful of the facilities and cleaning up after yourself.  If you notice a problem anywhere in the facility, please alert a member of the Plot Team or Staff immediately.

Pick up packets at the end of each fight or mod.  If they are wet, torn, or damaged, please throw them away.

You are responsible for cleaning your cabin at the end of the event.  This includes removal of personal items, trash removal, turning off lights, fans, the AC/Heat unit, and if necessary, sweeping and mopping.  For cabins with bathrooms and kitchens, this includes cleaning of these areas.

Smoking in the cabins is prohibited.  You must field strip your cigarettes.  If you do not know what this is, read here: https://www.wikihow.com/Field-Strip-a-Cigarette Please do not leave cigarette butts on the ground.

Do not bash specific groups or people.  It is okay to complain about circumstances and events without being specific.

Camp Loud Thunder:  Do not disturb any non-Chronicles campers.  If approached, be respectful and direct them to Plot Team or Staff.


# COVID Precautions

# Character Conversion from NERO & Alliance



* You may import your NERO or Alliance character to Chronicles ONCE.  This option is available to any player with a NERO or Alliance character.
* Importing your character does not invalidate your NERO LARP/Alliance membership or characters.
* Attending Chronicles events will have no impact on your NERO or Alliance character.  After conversion, attending NERO and Alliance events will have no impact on your Chronicles character.
* All NERO & Alliance build points transfer to Chronicles as Skill Points.  If this number is below one hundred, you will start with one hundred Skill Points in Chronicles.
* Your former Transform does NOT carry over into Chronicles.


### Money, Gems & Items

Coins, gems, and/or bank values from NERO & Alliance do not transfer to Chronicles. Nor will any magic or production items.


### Goblin Points

Goblin Points from NERO do not transfer to Chronicles, but we do have our own Goblin Point reward system you can participate in.

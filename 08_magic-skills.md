# Magic Skills

## Mastery Skills

---
A Mastery skill is purchased in order to grant a character access to a school of magic. The skill itself is the prerequisite for purchasing your first Mana Attunement of the given school, and provides a passive benefit that may be used.

| Magic Skill Costs | F   | T   | R   | S   |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Arcane Mastery    | 5   | 5   | 5   | 3   |
| Spirit Mastery    | 5   | 5   | 5   | 3   |
| Nature Mastery    | 5   | 5   | 5   | 3   |

### Arcane Mastery
This skill allows the character to spend one minute of concentration to attune themselves to the flow of Evren’s Aether in order to detect magic by simply touching an item or person. Once the character has achieved attunement, the character may continue to detect magic until their concentration is broken. This detect magic ability will reveal the presence of magic on an item, or person, and the type of magic that is present. There does exist some magic able to fool even these extraordinary senses. 


### Spiritual Mastery
This skill allows the character to briefly sense the presence of recently untethered spirits. A character skilled in Spiritual Mastery can also attempt to speak with the still tethered spirit of the recently deceased. To attempt a communication with the dead, the character must concentrate for one minute and roleplay contact with the body of the dead. While in contact with the body and still in concentration, the character may speak with the spirit of the dead. This skill does not halt the death count of the dead character and the communication immediately ends when the spirit becomes untethered.

### Nature Mastery
This skill allows the character the occasional ability to sense extreme danger, possibly even gaining temporary sight from a nearby animal in a position to warn the character. The character with the skill Natural Mastery cannot control these abilities, it is entirely up to the Plot Team to determine when the character receives these warnings and visions.


## Mana Attunement

---
In order to cast a spell, you must possess the appropriate Mastery skill, and purchase ranks of Mana Attunement. Each rank of Mana Attunement you purchase in a given school gives you 10 Points of Mana, which may be spent to cast any spell from that school, on a 1:1 basis, where Mana is equivalent to a spell rank. So after your first attunement is purchased, you could cast 10 Rank I spells, or 2 Rank V spells, or any other combination adding up to 10. These spells can be chosen on the fly, allowing for spell casters to be highly flexible. Some may prefer to Memorize their spells in advance, giving them a clearer guide on what they are capable of. If a character chooses to use Memorization, they gain a bonus 10% to their Mana Pool, so someone with a single Mana Attunement who Memorizes would have 11 Mana, or someone with 5 Attunements would have 55 Mana that they could assign to their Memorized spells.

| Attunement Cost      |  F   |  T   |   R    |    S    |     Prereqs      |
|:---------------------|:----:|:----:|:------:|:-------:|:----------------:|
| Primary Attunement   | 10+2 | 6+1  | 8+1.5  |  4+.5   | Relevant Mastery |
| Secondary Attunement | 20+4 | 12+2 |  16+3  |   8+1   | Relevant Mastery |
| Tertiary Attunement  | 30+6 | 18+3 | 24+4.5 | 12.+1.5 | Relevant Mastery |

| **Description** |  This spell takes 1 minutes to cast and requires an untethered spirit. At the beginning of the spell, the target must clearly acknowledge the acceptance of the spell, if they do not, the spell fails to no effect. Once the spell begins, the target's body begins to immediately reform, incurring strain as per a normal resurrection. The caster must be in concentration and unimpeded for the entire casting time of this spell, else the spell will fail. If the caster’s concentration is interrupted, or the reforming body is affected by any detrimental effect, the spell fails and the target immediately suffers a second death. Prior to the casting time the player of the caster, and the player of the untethered spirit, are to verify that the spirit does not have too much strain to resurrect. A marshal should also be present to oversee the process. Once the Resurrection spell is complete, the spirit instantly reforms its body next to the spell caster. The body appears with a full health pool, and all skills renewed as if they had completed a long rest.  This is a LIFE effect. |

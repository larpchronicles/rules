## Cabins

---

## Headband Rules

---
### Orange Headbands - Non Combatants & Pages
Pages are people that are unable to enter combat.  They may be children or adults, although any child under age 14 must be a Page.  Pages may not use combat skills, weapons, or throw packets.

**You may not ever physically strike a Page.**  If you engage in combat with a page, you may point your weapon or packet and say, "Page, I kill you."  They cannot participate in combat.  They are treated as if they have 1 health point/body.

### White Headbands - Out of Game
Once you arrive on site, you are entering an In Game Area.  If you are not in game as your character yet, you must have a white headband on.  If you do not have a white headband, you may request one from the Plot Team or Staff.  If there are none available, you may signify your out of game status by holding a hand to your forehead or touching the top of your head with a held item.  This gesture is accepted as an out of character signal and frequently used by NPCs when not in game.

If you are in game, you should not react or speak to anyone that is wearing a white headband without first going out of game yourself.  It is generally seen as poor etiquette to break the environment for others.

When your character dies and your dying count has expired, after dropping all in game items, you should put on a white headband and go to Logistics/NPC Camp to register your death.  Your spirit cannot interact in any manner with others.


## Hold & Medic Calls

---
If you hear anyone call "Hold" or "Medic" you must immediately stop all activity, movement, and be silent unless directed otherwise.  If you are physically able to, drop to one knee.  **These calls indicate an Out of Game emergency.**

Only the persons who have been identified as a Medic by the Plot Team or Staff should respond to the call of "Medic."  A Medic is an individual with CPR and/or First Aid certification or has a license to practice medicine.

Please do not call "Hold" or "Medic" unless you or someone else is injured in real life.


## In Game vs. Out of Game Areas & Combat

---
Out of Game Areas are areas that you are not permitted to engage in combat in.  You may not chase PCs or NPCs into these areas nor use these areas to hide from In Game events, NPCs, etc.

Bathrooms, showers, and Logistics/NPC Camp are considered Out of Game Areas.

**No-Combat Areas**
>Camp Eastman
>
> The kitchen, stairwell, and second floor of the Lodge are considered In Game, but combat is disallowed.
>
> The kitchen in the dining hall (tavern) is also considered In Game and combat is disallowed in this area.

Unless otherwise noted by the Plot Team or Staff, all other areas are considered In Game.


## General Etiquette

---
Help ensure we can return to these sites for future events by being respectful of the facilities and cleaning up after yourself.  If you notice a problem anywhere in the facility, please alert a member of the Plot Team or Staff immediately.

Pick up packets at the end of each fight or mod.  If they are wet, torn, or damaged, please throw them away.

You are responsible for cleaning your cabin at the end of the event.  This includes removal of personal items, trash removal, turning off lights, fans, the AC/Heat unit, and if necessary, sweeping and mopping.  For cabins with bathrooms and kitchens, this includes cleaning of these areas.

Smoking in the cabins is prohibited.  You must field strip your cigarettes.  If you do not know what this is, read here: https://www.wikihow.com/Field-Strip-a-Cigarette Please do not leave cigarette butts on the ground.

Do not bash specific groups or people.  It is okay to complain about circumstances and events without being specific.


## COVID Precautions

---
We follow guidelines from the CDC and the state of Illinois.  Please get your vaccinations.  If you feel sick, stay home.

Face masks are welcome.  NPC Camp/Logistics will have N95 and KN95 masks available at check in.

### Covid Tests
(As of 2022-07-30)

Currently, we are requiring a negative COVID test result in order to participate in the event.  Tests may be taken as early as two days prior to the event.  NPC Camp/Logistics will have some tests available during check in, however it is strongly suggested that you test prior to driving out.

COVID Resources, How to get Tests, and Test Submission info can be found here: http://larpchronicles.com/covid

## Disciplinary Rules

---
While we never hope this to be the case, if anyone is breaking Chronicles rules, the Code of Conduct, violating the rules of the rental site, or causing problems and/or disruptions to the event, they will be subject to an escalating response from Plot and Staff.  This is outlined with more detail in the [Code of Conduct](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1baIH6NfjVpb-K-hI59ebrd4vWQlcjtTT/view?usp=sharing).


# Races

## Brood
---
**Physical Description**:

Brood may appear with iridescent brown complexions with varied color markings, carapaces, and large claws.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 1 Year.


**Median Life Expectancy**: 9 Years.


**Maximum Lifespan**: 30 Years.


**Overview**:

Initially, all Brood were connected to each other through the Hive Mind and were drones with no distinctiveness of personality.  Beginning with a single Brood, the concept of individualism began to spread, and with it, a disconnect from the Hive Mind.  Many Brood were not able to withstand being severed from the Hive this way and did not survive.


Those that did were able to act with autonomy, adopted their own names, and continually sought ways to express their newfound individuality.  The Brood began painting and marking themselves with various colors and using this to create distinct appearances and a stronger sense of identity for themselves.


Overall, other races regard the Brood as a terrifying race capable of great destruction and the majority are unaware of any difference between the two types of Brood.  As their presence is likely to typically cause alarm and panic, it is incredibly rare to see one of these Brood within a town.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Innate Claws*: Built for battle and a readiness to defend themselves, Brood have a set of limbs with large claws.  Possessing such natural weapons, they are unable to take up the physical weapons of other races.  Passively, all Brood have natural claws that deal a base of 1 Physical and qualify for all Unarmed Martial Skills requiring Unarmed Combat.  Brood cannot wield any weapons other than shields.


*Rip Free*: Brood abhor the sensation of being trapped and when they find themselves in such a situation, they will do anything in their power to regain their freedom. Once per rest, a Brood may have one free usage of Escape Artist.


*Acidic Secretion*:  Along with being capable of great destruction in general, Brood have acidic blood that is capable of destroying items._  Once per day, a Brood may spend 1 minute in concentration to destroy an item.


**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  All Brood player characters must use a different colored paint to add markings and may not only have brown or black paint.  The design and color of these markings is player choice.  Physical representations for the carapace should be present and may be colored brown or black and given an iridescent coating.

## Dwarf

---
**Physical Description**:

Dwarves appear with complexions ranging from pale to ebony and are commonly recognized by their full-beards and great, bushy eyebrows.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 30 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 150 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  250 Years.

**Overview**:

The Dwarven people of Evren are a sturdy race of people who hail from the mountainous regions.  Rarely given toward verbosity or activities they believe are unrefined and requiring improvement, Dwarves have received a reputation of being brusque and hypercritical.

This race once ruled a wide part of Evren with many villages filled with fantastic creations of ingenuity and inspired design.  Over half a millenia ago, when the Iblis invaded Evren, the Dwarven people suffered greatly, and lost control over much of their territories and their bastion of knowledge.  In the counter-attacks that ultimately pushed the Iblis back, the Dwarves were indispensable for their crafters.  Now, generations later, none truly remember the losses of their ancestors, and have long since turned their focus back toward building a vast mining empire and achieving ever greater levels of craftsmanship.


**Racial Abilities**:


*Improved Constitution*: Hardy and strong, Dwarves have a natural resistance toward many substances. Once per rest, a Dwarf may resist a toxin by calling “Resist Toxin.”


*Tricks of the Trade*: Dwarves are masters of all things crafting, and as such have learned how to cut the occasional corner. Once per day, a Dwarf may add 1 additional Durability to an item that is being created by themselves or another crafter.


**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Both male and female Dwarves appear with beards.


## Elf

---
**Average Age of Adulthood**: 50 Years.


**Median Life Expectancy**: 225 Years.


**Maximum Lifespan**:  250-300 Years.


**Racial Abilities**:


*Life Bound*: _Their long lives and vibrant life force makes them particularly resistant to negative spell effects._ Once per rest, an Elf may Resist Spell.


*Lore-Master*: _The longevity of the Elves means there are few stories that haven’t reached their ears_. Once per day, an Elf can attempt to recall something specific about an Evren area.  This must be done with Plot.




### Dark Elf

**Physical Description**:

Dark Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from white to pale.  They can sometimes be recognized by red markings around their eyes.

**Overview**:

The Dark Elven people primarily live deep below the surface of Evren.  Built within expansive networks of subterranean tunnels and caverns, their cities are elaborate and intricate wonders constructed long ago with a unique material that gives their constructions a glossy appearance like polished obsidian, but is much less brittle.

The Dark Elves themselves are known to be a bit xenophobic or isolationist, depending on the viewpoint. Socially, they are organized into matriarchal Houses.  Within their culture, the House you are born to or employed by is typically an indicator of overall status, as some are much more affluent  and influencing than others.

A Dark Elf with no such House affiliation is akin to an unknown.  In more polite circles, the avoidance of interaction is reasoned as not knowing how to properly address or interact with the Houseless individual, Elf or not.  More commonly, anyone lacking a House affiliation is generally seen as a non-citizen and thought to be a creature of no consequence with little to no importance and not worth direct attention.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  If a paler complexion is desired, it is recommended to use a lighter makeup foundation rather than to rely on white paint.  For the red eye markings, how they are added is player discretion and may be as simple as smudges, red eye-liner, lines, red eyeshadow, or no red markings at all.



### High Elf

**Physical Description**:

High Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from fair to ebony.

**Overview**:

High Elves are one of the most common Elves found in Evren.  Being more abundant across Evren, it should come as no surprise that these Elves frequently break down into regional or political groups such as Elves in the Red Desert often being referred to as “Desert Elves.”

The High Elves are typically perceived by others to be snobbish or elitist.  The reality of this is that they probably are.  Most, if accused of being elitist, would more than likely assert this as truth, as to deny it, in their views, would be akin to the delusion that High Elves are not superior to other Elves that, while Elf-shaped, are far too primitive and barbaric.



### Moon Elf

**Physical Description**:

Moon Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from white to pale.  They are typically recognized due to staining their skin with silver-colored dye.

**Overview**:

The majority of Moon Elves call Southwood home and live in a sprawling city where many buildings seem to have been grown from only silver and moonstone.

A widely held belief among the Moon Elves explains their practice of staining their skin silver: The Great Mother and Great Father formed the Elven race long ago, and in the birth of their race, the Mother's form exploded, becoming the stars in the night sky.  Forlorn without her, the Father transformed himself into the moon and joined her in the sky, but found he could not gaze upon only his beloved.

The Father turned his face upon Evren, providing a guiding light for their children at night and casting a pale, watchful face over them in the daytime. Each month, he will slowly turn away and face only the Mother to share a private moment away from the eyes of their children.

During this time of darkness, the sap of the central tree within their city turns silver.  It has become the practice of these Elves, each month, to mark the skin of their infants during their first new moon.  Many Elves continue to mark and stain their skin with the sap throughout their life, to mark everything from a coming of age to achieving spiritual growth.  The time of a new moon is a sacred time to the Moon Elves, as they believe it is the only time the Father and the Mother may create life again.

Their temperaments are varied, though most present themselves as stoic individuals with a quiet seriousness.  This behavior can sometimes appear as an attitude of aloofness or reserve.  The illusion is typically broken by the presence of someone the Moon Elf knows, prompting them toward displaying sudden warmth and openness.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Silver markings are largely up to the player.  Some examples of this may be flecks, lines, or the only visible color of the complexion.



### Sun Elf

**Physical Description**:

Sun Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from tan to a rich golden color.  They are often recognized by a golden sheen resulting from staining.

**Overview**:

The Sun Elves can primarily be found throughout the many islands of the archipelago.  Traveling from island to island, these Elves have become experts at navigation and utilize a unique mapping technique to map ocean swells with esoteric creations of sticks. shells, and twine.  Equipped with these stick maps, the knowledge to read them, and their massive catamarans, the Sun Elves live a transient, seafaring life.

The golden complexion of Sun Elves began long ago with a misguided belief that a particular gold mica laden cream would protect their skin from the harshness of the sun – a necessity for a people frequently under it.  Living mostly in small communities that frequently intermix, it is no surprise that the use of gold mica laden creams has become ubiquitous.  Today, the Sun Elves continue the practice of staining their skin as part of their naming ceremony as infants or any various coming of age tradition.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Achieving the golden complexion of a Sun Elf can typically be done with Mehron products.  It is not suggested to apply glitter due to the possibility of it getting in the eyes.



### Wild Elf

**Physical Description**:

Wild Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions from fair to ebony.  They are often recognized by visible markings or tattoos.

**Overview**:

Many of the Wild Elves – so named by the High Elves – make their homes either in Elven kingdoms or in the treetops of many Evren forests.  Regarded as masters of these untamed areas, they will frequently be referred to as rangers and are considered to be rather sneaky and elusive.  Equally, these Elves are frequently thought of as unnerving to face in a fight due to their use of ululating war cries.

The Wild Elves consider themselves to simply be better than others at living with nature and understanding its patterns rather than foolishly attempting to change nature to suit their own needs.  Even their homes, built upon platforms that sprawl from one tree to another, utilize the natural branching and existing foliage of the trees to support and camouflage their presence.

Socially, these Elves are broken down into various regional Groves, led by an elected council of five referred to as the Root.  Like the roots of a tree, the Root is responsible for supporting the Grove from the bottom up.  In an effort to maintain balance, each council member of the Root shares an equal say, which can sometimes result in changes as rapidly shifting as the weather or with a steady dependability.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Markings and tattoos can be done in any style desired by the player and in any color.


## Glimmerling

---
**Physical Description**:

Glimmerlings appear with a variety of complexions.  They are sometimes recognized by horns, antennae, wings, pointed ears, large noses, additional eyes, tails, etc.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 18 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 120 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  200 Years.

**Overview**:

Old wives tales will claim the Glimmerling people are the result of Humans having intermingled with the Fae of ancient legend.  Just as those stories contain many different descriptions, so too are the Glimmerlings wildly diverse in appearance and temperament.

Most people view the Glimmerlings with no difference to how they view the fairies of folktales, which is to say, there is very little open trust granted and more than a little suspicion.  This is of course aided by the tendency of many Glimmerlings to be merciless, mischievous tricksters – though in their opinion, they are simply having some fun and don’t all people like fun?

**Racial Abilities**:

*Remembrance*: Being connected to the realm of dreams, Glimmerlings are able to delve into the memories of another person. Once per rest, a Glimmerling may concentrate and establish a connection to a consenting character and aid them in recovering memories for as long as the other chooses to keep the contact.  This is a purely roleplayed ability and may not be used to determine truth.  If attempting to use this ability to recall specific plot information, seek a plot member beforehand, so they can be on hand to describe what you witness.

*Trickster*: Glimmerlings as a race, are very cunning and crafty and delight in causing the occasional confusion and chaos. Once per day, a Glimmerling may recall to a pre-designated location ala the same rules as Rune of Recall and call, “Activate Recall, 1 I recall, 2 I recall, 3 I recall.”  They must drop any items acquired prior to vanishing.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Physical representations of any unique characteristics should be done.

## Goblin

---
**Physical Description**:

Goblins appear with green complexions, pointed ears, and long, pointed noses that may have large warts.  Most Goblins are bald, but it is common to see them in gaudy wigs.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 5 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 30 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  60 Years.

**Overview**:

Hailing from nearly all reaches of Evren, Goblins are descendants of a race once imbued with magic and connected to a protective and empowering being their shamans refer to as the All-Father.  While each tale will likely vary as to why they are no longer linked to any such creature, Goblins today do not look at this as some kind of loss, but rather that they are much stronger without the fetters of dependency.

Resourceful and clever, if not traditionally wise, Goblins are unreservedly proud of their achievements.  The scale or scope of the achievement rarely factors in, so long as, to their perception, something was completed in a way that brought them satisfaction.  Sharing such gratification with others, or worse, being forced to credit another for their accomplishment is not only demoralizing, but often treated as an affront and impugnment of their person.

In ages long since past, Goblins were subjugated and enslaved by Orcs on the heels of the Orcs themselves having gained their own freedom.  This lasted for about as long as it took Goblins to outsmart the Orcs, which is to say, not very long.  Still, a bitterness toward Orc-kind remains today in many Goblin communities.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Improvised Equipment*: Exceptionally enterprising in a pinch, Goblins are innovative and quick-thinking individuals that are undaunted by a “broken” piece of equipment.  Once per rest, a Goblin may use a weapon, shield, or piece of armor that is broken until their next rest.  After this use, the item crumbles and may not be repaired or salvaged.

*Run Away*: Being so incredibly clever sometimes has its pitfalls, and the sudden need to “get out of dodge” is a unique skill all Goblins seem to develop.  Once per day, a Goblin may elect to flee an encounter by yelling, “RUN AWAY!”  For 10 seconds, this Goblin may Dodge an unlimited number of times, but must be physically fleeing.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Achieving pointed ears that slope back or downward can be done by wearing Elf ears backwards.

## Kindred

---
**Physical Description**:

Individuals appear with a variety of complexions, markings, and body parts.  They are recognized most commonly by appearing as a distinct humanoid-animal hybrid.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 30 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 150 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  250 Years.

**Overview**:

A fairly rare sight in Evren, the Kindred are the most diverse of the races in the sense that there are many different types, each appearing as an anthropomorphic form of another creature.  Being such wildly varied people, it should come as no surprise that their cultures, beliefs, appearances, and practices will all differ from one to another.  What the Kindred do share is the common trait of perseverance in the face of animosity.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Ferocity*: Kindred may call upon their inner ferocity to power their blows. Once per rest, a Kindred can announce “Ferocity” to activate this ability, adding +5 weapon damage against one enemy.  A Kindred under this effect may not run from a fight and is immune to fear effects. Lasts 5 minutes.

*Begin the Hunt*: Possessing similar strengths to the creatures they resemble, many Kindred have become adept at honing and relying on their instincts or acute senses.  Once per day, a Kindred may focus themselves and enhance an existing purchase of Tracking by 1 additional Slot.  If the Kindred has 0 Tracking, they may use an assumed 2 for this ability.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Facepaint and physical representations should be present and match the animal-type for your specific Kindred.


## Kobold

---
**Physical Description**:

Kobolds appear as reptilian humanoids with red or blue scaled complexions, black nostrils, blackened eye sockets, and an elongated, flattened snout akin to caiman or crocodiles.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 3 years

**Median Life Expectancy**: 7 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  15 Years.

**Overview**:

Kobolds can typically be found living in small, roving clans or in rustic, out of the way settlements. From the outsider’s perspective, Kobolds and their communities are grossly lacking in laws and rife with theft.  This extends to the belief that the primary interests of every Kobold fall to impulsively gathering up anything interesting or shiny that isn’t nailed down hard enough to keep them from making off with it and with the thing it is nailed to.  That is to say, most people believe that to Kobolds, there are only two properties of ownership:  “mine and things I don’t care about.”

Bright-eyed and precocious, Kobolds are among the shortest lived races, with all the chaotic cleverness and volubility it takes to get by.  When it comes to their supposed kleptomania, the majority of Kobolds will vehemently dispute any such accusation.

Kobolds typically respect the notions of ownership and possession, for anything they have an emotional attachment to is something they consider theirs and they would go to great lengths to keep it that way.  For everything else, a Kobold is likely to tell you that possession is entropic.

The worth most Kobolds place on things has very little to do with its intrinsic value or utility and everything to do with whether or not the object has captured their attention and or imagination. Uniquely held concepts such as this persist among most Kobolds, often presenting views and ideas about the world around them and how it works with a perceived naivety or ingenuousness.

**Racial Abilities**:

*MY SHINY* - Kobolds are distinctly aware of the entropic nature of having things and so will closely guard things that are of great importance to them – or things that are important to them today.  Once per rest, a Kobold may declare one item on their person as protected, preventing the item from being taken from them, even in death.  This status lasts only until the start of their next rest, when they may declare another thing.  If the protected item is a container, only the container is protected, nothing inside of it.

*Ooo, Shiny* - Kobolds are well-known for their impulsive nature of taking things they believe are interesting or needed.  Once per day, a Kobold may scrounge up a random item.  This must be done with Plot.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  The particular shade or hue of blue or red is up to the player.  The eye sockets should be blacked out up to the eyebrows and may extend to create angular shapes.  The nostrils should be black and come to small triangular tips just above the nostril.  Physical representations for horns and tails are encouraged.

## Orc

---
**Physical Description**:

Orcs appear with green complexions and are recognized by their protruding lower teeth.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 15 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 40 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  80 Years.

**Overview**:

Like the grassy streaks that never seem to quite wash out of that favorite pair of pants, a viridian stain of Orcish clans spread across the central lands of Evren.  Most of the other races steer clear of them, though it is not unheard of to find pockets of Goblins existing either among them or in villages situated somewhere an Orc claims as their territory.

The capital-D Dominance-based culture of these Orcs is more than just how their hierarchical society gets structured, it is a way of life that comes more naturally than breathing.  With this consideration, some other races may be confused at how Orc society has become matriarchal until one stops to consider that the needs and urges that feed into this culture are present within Orcs even as children, and who would they most likely challenge but their own caretakers?

The basis of this culture does not hinge much on codes of honor or only fighting “the right way.”  To most Orcs, the way to establish Dominance is to do whatever it takes to still be standing and if that involves trickery and cunning, then that is exactly how they’ll accomplish it.  After all, they learned all about the value of outsmarting their opponents from the Goblins they once subjugated.  But, Orcs do not exactly pride themselves on being smarter than their opponent, just being strong enough to make their opponent dumber by way of repeated blows to the head.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Rub Dirt In It*: Orcs are strong and their beliefs are as strong, if not stronger.  In fact, an Orc’s faith in their own toughness and ability allows them the firm certainty that cramming a wound full of dirt is a sure way to heal it – but only small wounds, and only sometimes.  Once per rest, an Orc may restore a dying character to 1 Health Point/Body.

*Last Stand*: Like an Orc’s faith in dirt’s ability to heal, an Orc has an even truer faith in themselves to outlast even the limits of their bodies.  Once per day, an Orc may take their last stand and become immune to everything for 10 seconds.  After use, the Orc falls over dead and requires a Life/Revivify spell.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Protruding lower teeth should be physically represented in addition to a green complexion.


## Halfling

---
**Physical Description**:

Halflings have complexions that may range from fair to ebony, slightly pointed ears, and are often recognized by hair feet, hairy forearms, and long sideburns.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 30 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 90 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  150 Years.

**Overview**:

Typically rather practical, Halflings are community-oriented people that relish a good challenge or being presented with a new task to bend their considerable, natural intellect toward.  They are often viewed as rather industrious due to their advances in homestead technologies and it is not uncommon for a Halfling to be seen working on a city planning council or to be sought out as a consultant for a variety of tasks.

Most often, Halflings make their homes in multi-race towns and villages, though all-Halfling communities certainly exist and are likely one of the most functional, well-run places it is possible to encounter.

The values held by the majority of Halflings are the home, the belly, and the mind – in that order, of course.  Without a home, there is not a place in which to feed the belly.  If you cannot feed the belly, then you cannot aptly use the mind.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Nimble Feet:* Halflings are known for having an uncanny talent for guessing exactly where that tree is going to fall or which way that box is going to explode.  Once per rest, a Halfling may Dodge any standard trap that has a tag.  This ability is treated as a DODGE effect and use of it may be called before or after a trap has been set off.

*Community Outreach*: The community is where the home is, and the belly, and the mind.  As such, it comes as no surprise that aiding the community is a talent that comes naturally to many Halflings. Once per day, a Halfling may substitute their ranks in Cooking, Performance, or Gambling with an equal number of ranks in a different Rest-boosting skill. Alternatively, they may boost the ranks of another’s Rest-boosting skill by +2.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Sideburns and excess hair can appear on all Halflings and should be physically represented in some visible manner.

## Human

---
**Physical Description**:

Humans may appear with complexions ranging from pale to ebony and may have varied markings or identifiers based on their region or culture.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 18 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 60 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  100 Years.

**Overview**:

Humans have been around Evren for as long as anyone can remember, and though their lifespan is not as lengthy as some races, they nevertheless make up for in the structures they establish, leave behind, reclaim, and rebuild.  They are a fairly common sight in nearly every region, as at some point, their natural inclination toward wanderlust will take over some individuals who strike out and begin yet another community somewhere new.

From their own perspectives, Humans are tenacious, steadfast, full of determination, and always striving toward greatness – though the exact definition of what greatness is will always vary.  Building villages into towns and cities, then establishing laws and governing entities are the main strengths of Humans and in their expert opinion, are things they do for the betterment of all races and helps establish fairness.

Outside opinions of Humans are perhaps not as gilded, as many other races would describe Humans as greedy, controlling creatures that wander about, declaring any open plot of ground their new property.  Expecting all others to follow any laws and regulations they set forth, and having the amazing gall to refer to themselves as the “normal-looking ones.”  Not all opinions of Humans boil down to this perspective, of course.  There are plenty of people that happily coexist within Human towns that have become melting pots of mixed cultures and races.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Survivor*: Humans are incredibly adaptable and able to survive when most others would not. Once per rest, a Human may have a free usage of Endurance by spending 1 minute of concentration to prime the ability. While primed, if the user reaches 59 seconds of their Dying count, this ability triggers to return the target to 1 Body instead of becoming Dead, and the user must declare “Endurance”. This is an ENDURE effect. An individual cannot have more than one primed ENDURE effect at once.

*Connected*: Humans are the most prevalent race on Evren and their propensity for establishing contacts across all walks of life is a trait many have become adept at within both the underworld and legitimate enterprises. Once per day, a Human may locate an impromptu black market in which only the character can enter.  This must be done with Plot.

___
## Unbound

---
**Physical Description**:

Unbound appear with complexions of blue, red, orange, brown, or grey with bright streaks, lines, or cracks of glowing power.  These lines typically appear as white or as more luminous colors of their complexions.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 20 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 90 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  150 Years.

**Overview**:

When asked about their origins, most Unbound are unlikely to have an answer.  Those that do, will likely speak of an ancient tale about an event known as The Night of Madness.  Half a millennium ago, there existed a people called the Taitrel.  The Taitrel appeared quite similarly to Humans, yet with startlingly bright eyes in icy blues, fiery reds and oranges, stone greys, earthy browns, and electric yellows.

For the Taitrel people, The Night of Madness began with a chaotic wave of elemental force that washed across their lands, decimating their population and reducing their homes to rubble.  Those that survived this incident, found themselves to possess bodies with complexions in the very same colors they once attributed as simple eye colors.  Bright lines of power rippled across their newly colored forms line veins of pure, luminous, elemental power.  The Taitrel were no longer.  They had become something else – something more.  Something unbound.

Though scattered all about Evren, it did not take long for the refugees to find each other.  Faced with rampant xenophobia bred by the continent-spanning Godslayer Wars, the Unbound banded together and carved out small territories for themselves.  These small territories grew into factions, typically led by individuals with exceptional qualities that aligned with what is most valued by a particular faction.

The Unbound that may be found alone are typically those that have established themselves as civil-minded mediators and advisors among other races, despite their somewhat fearsome appearance.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Elemental Blood*: The Unbound can tap into their elemental nature to either spend their vitality to attack others or they may absorb the elemental energies from an incoming attack, and be healed by it. Once per rest, Unbound may spend X number of body to use as a packet delivered spell (“Spell X*2 &lt;Element>”).  Alternatively, they may instead receive healing from an incoming attack of the character’s chosen element.(“Appears to Heal Me”).

*Elemental Transmutation*: The Unbound are amalgamations of elemental forces and living beings. As such they are able to tap into the makeup of matter. Once per day, an Unbound may transmogrify a single component of any rank into a different, single component of the same rank.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: To make glowing lines of power, it’s suggested to use white paint and either line it with a thin black line or put a thin line of color through the middle of the white in order to create a colored line that appears to glow.  Facepaint aside from the glowing lines should match the elemental type of your character.  Ie:  Fire should be red or red-orange tones and hues, electricity should be grey, but may be blue, water should be blue, and stone should be earthy browns or rocky grey. 

## Unforgiven

---
**Physical Description**:

Unforgiven appear with a red complexion with smoky black shadowing, black horns that sprout from the skull or face, and a thin barbed tail.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 20 Years

**Median Life Expectancy**: 90 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  130 Years.

**Overview**:

Over half a millennium ago, during the Godslayer Wars, the Iblis people opened an inter-planar gate from their home to Evren, through which they staged an invasion of what is now known as the Khuurai Steppe and the region north of Lac Gronk.  Their appearance was more than enough to initially terrify most and for many years, they roamed the western lands, bringing battle to those that chose not to flee.

Their conquest was short-lived, however, as they lacked the organization to unite their territories in a lasting empire. Their relentless advance was eventually halted, then reversed as a series of brutal counter-attacks from their neighbors crippled the overextended invaders.  Too intensely pressured by the creatures they had initially thought of as little more than sport, the horned invaders fled back through their gate, hastily closing it.  Many of the Iblis were left stranded, forced to face the mercy of a world they had shattered.

Persecuted by the angry Evrens, the numbers of the unintentional refugees dwindled as more and more of them went into hiding and the Iblis became convinced of one thing:  they would never be forgiven by the people of Evren.  Generations passed and as the memories of these events faded into legend, so, too, did the stigma formerly attached to the name they had taken:  Unforgiven.

A rare sight today, the Unforgiven began appearing again and integrating themselves into other societies.  While some may be put off by their appearance and liken them to old stories of demons, they are generally accepted in mixed-race towns and cities.  In these scarce sightings, the Unforgiven will have typically become a distinguished individual of either exceptional skill or of singular intelligence and wit.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Call To Darkness*: Most Unforgiven today likely owe their very existence to their ancestors’ cultivation of slipping away into their own shadow.  For some, this may seem like a trick of the eyes or that an Unforgiven has managed to hide away in plain sight; however, they remain very much visible, but for a short time, enjoy the safety the darkness grants them.  The aptitude for managing such a feat remains prevalent even into modern times.  Once per rest, an Unforgiven may spend 5 seconds in Concentration in order to slip into their own shadow and take the INVULNERABLE effect for 1 minute.  Within their own shadow, an Unforgiven is unable to move, communicate with others, nor use items or skills.  The Unforgiven is immune to all game effects, except SOLIDIFY and Dispel Magic.

*Guileless Contrac*t:  Motivated by either their own amusement or safety, Unforgiven have an unabashed penchant for deceiving and deluding others; however, when it comes to moments where the truth matters, they become intensely serious and many have learned to focus their will toward ensuring such moments are devoid of falsehoods.  Once per day, an Unforgiven can enact a binding contract between themselves and a consenting individual that lasts for 10 minutes.  During this time, neither party can intentionally tell a lie to the other person.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Horn sizes and placements may vary at player discretion, but should be black or dark in color.  Some Unforgiven players choose to “hide” their barbed tail, but otherwise this should also be physically represented.


# Combat Rules

## Appropriate Strike Zones

---
	Pending.

## Armor: Immunities

---
In the event that you are hit by an ability that you are immune to, your armor does not take the damage.

## Armor: Receiving Damage

---
During combat, when damage is taken by a character, it is first deducted from the Armor Point total, unless otherwise stated by a specific spell or skill. If the player still has Armor Points remaining, it does not matter which location is covered by armor, they will still deduct the damage from their remaining points.

## Bows: Blocking

---
Bows may be used to block attacks.  Bows may also be used to block attacks while wielding a Short Weapon, if the Short Weapon & Bow skill is purchased.  If used to block an attack, you must spend a 3 second count to restring the bow before you can use it again.  

## Casting Spells

---
Casting a spell is an act of will and physical effort combined, gathering the energy that the caster has prepared in their memory and then throwing it out into the world. In LARP Chronicles, a spell’s energy is represented by a "spell packet", a small bundle of cloth, usually filled with bird seed, that is thrown at, or touched against other participants, in order to use your magic.

When casting a spell, first you must have a spell packet in hand. Then, you cast the spell by stating the incant, each spell having its own unique incant, and then either touching the packet to the intended target, or throwing it. If your spell packet strikes a target successfully, they are affected as per the spell’s description, unless they are capable of resisting the magic. 

You must be careful when casting spells, because if an enemy is within reach, or they have a ranged weapon, you risk your spell being disrupted mid-cast if they manage to strike you with a weapon blow, or if you take damage from any source during the incant. If your spell is disrupted, it is lost and you must complete a rest to recover it.

Some spells require a "X count" to cast where X may be three or five.  This is always intended to be X number of seconds.

## Charging

---
Charging refers to your proximity to another player in melee combat.  In combat, combatants should never be inside the physical reach another combatant.  Combatants should not be able to make skin to skin contact.
* Charging unfairly prevents one combatant from attacking their combat partner.
* Charging can prevent a combatant from being able to attack safely and can result in players being struck in illegal strike zones or injuries to areas such as the eyes.
* Charging forces one combatant to backpedal or retreat.  We often play on uneven ground and this could result in a player tripping and sustaining injuries.

## Damage Calls, Types, Flavors, & Carriers

---
Casting Damage calls are how you communicate the amount of damage being delivered, as well as its type and whether or not it has a flavor modifier or carrier.  You may only use one value for each option.

**Damage Call Structure** 
```
# <Type> [Flavor/Carrier(optional)]
```

Examples:
* 5 Normal
* 2 Magic Flame
* 23 Silver Death

Suppose you have a normal longsword, a transform with the Magic Aura and Flame Aura abilities, and a Frost coating applied to the weapon. You would swing one of:
* 5 Magic
* 5 Normal
* 5 Magic Flame
* 5 Normal Flame
* 5 Magic Frost
* 5 Normal Frost

| Damage Types | Damage Flavors | Damage Carriers |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Magic        | Flame          | Curse           |
| Normal       | Frost          | Death           |
| Poison       | Shock          | Drain           |
| Silver       | Stone          | Vital           |


## Headbands:  Non-Combatants & Pages

---
People wearing orange headbands are referred to as Pages.  Pages are people that are unable to enter combat.  They may be children or adults, although any child under age 14 must be a Page.

**You may not ever physically strike a Page.**  Pages may not use combat skills, weapons, or throw packets.  If you engage in combat with a page, you may point your weapon or packet and say, "Page, I kill you."  They are treated as if they have 1 health point/body.

## Killing Blows

---
Killing Blow is a 3-count that can be interrupted. When Killing Blowed, the target becomes Dead. Killing Blow 1, Killing Blow 2, Killing Blow 3 <type>.

The target of a killing blow may refuse it, so long as they are capable of movement.  Any killing blow is assumed to automatically be refused by a target capable of movement, unless explicitly accepted by the target.

## Light Touch

---
    Pending.

## Magic Deliverance, Voice Radius, and Aether

---
Rarely, you may encounter entities that are capable of delivering magic quicker than normal, skipping the incantation and abridging it to simply Magic followed by the spell name, for example, Magic Fear. This is still an effective spell, and needs to be reacted to as such.

Similarly, some entities may deliver a spell via "Voice Radius," at which time anyone who can hear the declared spell, whether enemy or ally, is subject to it as if they’d been struck by the spell directly.

Finally, powerful creatures can sometimes deliver a spell as an Aether spell. If you are struck by an Aether spell, no resistances can prevent the effect, and you are affected by it immediately.

## Shields

---
The maximum surface area of a shield is 531 square inches. The longest dimension a shield may have is 36".

As long as the character has either hand on a shield, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the shield is considered effectively blocked.

Limitations:
* A shield may never be used for striking in combat. 
* Shields may not be used with two-hand weapons, bows, or crossbows.
* A character may not dual wield shields.
* Shields are not capable of blocking spell packets or toxins without the use of an ability.

## Speed of Combat

---
    Pending.

## Spell Packets

---
Anything in your possession being struck by a spell causes you to take the effect of the spell, even if it is an illegal strike zone.  If illegal strike zones are being targeted repeatedly, inform Plot or a member of Staff immediately.


### Spellstrikes

---
Spellstrikes are spells cast upon a target via a physically represented weapon.  Packets do not count, as this would be touch casting.  Spellstrikes may not be refused in the way touch casts can.  Defenses for spells such as Spell Mirror, Intercept, and Parry Spell are effective against Spellstrikes.  The Parry skill will not block the spell of a Spellstrike.  If you physically parry a Spellstrike, you take the effect of the spell.
	
### Touch Casting

---
If you are touching the target directly, they have the ability to "refuse your touch cast", causing you to expend the magic to no effect.  Any spell may be touch cast. The target of a touch cast spell may refuse the touch cast, so long as they are capable of movement. Any and every offensive or negative touch cast spell is assumed to automatically be refused unless explicitly accepted by the target.


### Turtling

---
    Pending.

## Weapons Safety Check

---
    Pending.


# Armor Rules

## Armor Mechanics

---
Armor is described as extra garb pieces made of defined materials and worn in targeted locations for the purpose of providing a character with extra defense in the form of Armor Points. A character can have a number of armor up to their Armor Cap determined by what skills they have purchased. If the character is not using Fencing or Stalwart defense, they must also properly phys-rep their armor, with the type of armor required depending on the total amount of armor. Phys-repped armor grants an equivalent based on the armor type and location. Finally, in order to benefit from their armor, the character must possess the appropriate armor item tag.

### Armor and Combat

During combat, when damage is taken by a character, it is first deducted from the Armor Point total, unless otherwise stated by a specific spell or skill. If the player still has Armor Points remaining, it does not matter which location is covered by armor, they will still deduct the damage from their remaining points.

Once a character’s Armor Points are below their maximum total, they may recover them through one of three methods:  
1. The Rapid Refit martial skill, which requires 5 seconds of uninterrupted roleplay to restore a character’s Armor Point total back to its maximum.
2. Roleplay- A character may spend 1 minute of uninterrupted roleplaying adjusting armor, straps and its fit to restore a character’s armor total back to its maximum.
3. Using a Repair Kit, a crafted item by Smiths, cuts the roleplay time required to repair armor in half, to 30 seconds.

## Armor Point Calculations

---
A character’s Armor Points are determined by the following:  
* Their purchased Armor Cap
* Their active skills
* The type of armor worn
* The location of worn armor
* The Armor Item Tag they possess

## Armor Types

---
### Cloth

Thick, quilted layers designed to blunt the worst of an adversary’s blow and prevent immediately fatal strikes.  
**Required** A three-layer, quilted fabric.

| **Cloth Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 2 |
| Shoulders | 2 |
| Torso | 4 |
| Legs | 2 |
| **Max Armor Bonus** | **10** |

### Leather
Treated animal hide widely used as a cost effective means of protection, while remaining soft and supple enough to be worked similarly to fabric without loss of the wearer’s mobility.
**Required**: Suede, supple leather, faux leather, or leather appearing fabric.


| **Leather Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 4 |
| Shoulders | 4 |
| Torso | 8 |
| Legs | 4 |
| ***Max Armor Bonus*** | ***20*** |


### Hard Leather
Hardened, formed leather that retains its shape and offers significantly more protection against piercing and slashing than it’s non-hardened counterpart. Less heavy than traditional metal armor, and more cost-effective for adventurers who lack coin.
**Required**: At least 4oz hardened veg tan leather, or analog that has the ability to retain its shape under mild pressure.  

| **Hard Leather Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 6 |
| Shoulders | 6 |
| Torso | 12 |
| Legs | 6 |
| ***Max Armor Bonus*** | ***30*** |

### Chain/Composite
Concentric, interlocking metal rings that provide a lighter alternative to full platemail armor, and allows for greater flexibility at the cost of sacrificing protection from piercing and crushing weapon blows.

**Required**: Chainmail, rigid interlocked or overlapping rings/plates, fabric with simulated/printed chainmail pattern.

| **Chain Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 8 |
| Shoulders | 8 |
| Torso | 16 |
| Legs | 8 |
| ***Max Armor Bonus*** | ***40*** |


### Plate
Heavy, durable metal armor that provides superior protection from all manner of enemy attacks.
**Required:** Solid formed metal plates, foam, plastic or other material that maintains its shape with firm pressure, preferably with an outward metallic appearance.

| **Plate Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 16 |
| Shoulders | 16 |
| Torso | 32 |
| Legs | 16 |
| ***Max Armor Bonus*** | ***80*** |	


## Armor Locations

---
While a player may wear armor wherever and however they choose as is thematically appropriate for their character, there are only 4 locations that will count toward a character’s final Armor Point total:

* Arms- Left and Right
* Shoulders- Left and Right
* Legs- Left and Right
* Torso - Front and Back

If a character only wears half of a paired location (arms, shoulders, legs), they will only get half the given value for that armor. \
>Example: Verse wears a plate pauldron on only his left shoulder, leaving his right shoulder uncovered.
 
This means it would count as 8 armor instead of the full 16. If he happened to wear a chain shirt that covered his other shoulder, that would give him another 4 points of armor (half of chain mail 8 for shoulder location.) For a total of 12 Armor from his two shoulders.

### ARMOR LOCATION REFERENCE
>Example: Spurt the Kobold has purchased enough Armor Training to raise their total Armor Cap to 30 points.
* They have not purchased any ranks in Fencing or Stalwart Defense, and so they must wear a phys rep of all their armor.
* Spurt is wearing a chain shirt (16 points), hard leather greaves (6 points), hard leather pauldrons (6 points), and cloth bracers (2 points).
* Spurt possesses an Armor Tag for 30 points of Armor.

Altogether, Spurt is wearing a total of 30 Armor Points, and has an Armor Cap of 30, which means they are able to use all of their Armor Points during combat.

>Example:  Villi the Forged has purchased enough Armor Training to raise their Armor Cap to 45 points.
* They have purchased 2 ranks of Stalwart Defense, which allows them to have another 10 Armor Points without an armor phys rep.
* They are wearing a plate torso piece (36 points), hard leather bracers (6 points) and hard leather greaves on their legs (6 points).
* Villi possesses an Armor Tag for 45 points of Armor.

Villi is wearing a total of 48 Armor Points, plus their ranks in Stalwart Defense which brings their total to 58. Because this is over their Armor Cap, they will only be able to use 55 Armor Points.

>Example:  Raphael the Elf has purchased enough Armor Training to raise their Armor Cap to 20 points.
* They have purchased 4 ranks of Fencing, which allows them to have another 20 Armor Points without an armor phys rep.
* They are wearing a chain torso piece (16 points) and leather bracers (4 points).
* Raphael currently does not possess an armor tag.

Raphael is wearing a total of 40 points of armor, 20 from phys reps and 20 from Fencing, however, because they do not possess an item tag for their armor, they may not benefit from any phys-repped armor. As such, their current armor total is 20 from Fencing. If Raphael gets an Armor Tag worth at least 20 points, they will be able to benefit from their full armor.


# Weapon Rules

## Weapon Requirements

---
* All combat reps must be certified as safe. Safety checks for all combat reps may be performed at check-in.  Safety checks MUST be performed EVERY EVENT; they do not carry over from prior events.  A marshal may request to inspect your reps at any time during the event, and, if deemed unsafe, may lose their safety certification.
* Claws / Bites or Unarmed weapons must be made to normal weapon specs, including approved core materials and must have more than a 4" striking surface.
* Real archery reps are disallowed.  Packet Bows are allowed on a case-by-case basis.


| WEAPON              | STRIKING SURFACE | HANDLE LENGTH | TOTAL LENGTH | HEAD REQUIRED |
|:--------------------|:----------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| Short Sword / Claws |    18" - 24"     |   5" - 14"    |   24" - 36"  |      No       |
| Short Blunt / Axe   |    18" - 24"     |   5" - 14"    |   24" - 36"  |      Yes      |
| Long Sword / Bites  |    18" - 36"     |   5" - 14"    |  >36" - 48"  |      No       |
| Long Blunt / Axe    |    18" - 36"     |   5" - 14"    |  >36" - 48"  |      Yes      |
| Two-Handed Sword    |    40" - 48"     |   5" - 30"    |  >48" - 62"  |      No       |
| Two-Handed Blunt    |    40" - 48"     |   5" - 30"    |  >48" - 62"  |      Yes      |
| Spear (One-Handed)  |    30" - 45"     |   5" - 30"    |   48" - 60"  |      No       |
| Polearm             |    40" - 48"     |   5" - 30"    |   60" - 72"  |      Yes      |

### Striking Surface ### 
The striking surface specifies the minimum and maximum amount of padded striking surface the weapon *must* have. _Any weapon that has less padding than the specified minimums will not pass inspection, even if it falls within the Total Length requirements!_

### Handle Length ###
The handle length specifies the minimum and maximum length of the handle by which the weapon can be wielded or held.

`Example: A Short Sword with a 14" handle will have to be at least 32" long overall, to accommodate the minimum striking surface length of 18" (14" handle + 18" striking surface = 32" total length). It is not possible to make a 24" long Short Sword that has a 14" handle; the blade would be only 10" long, which is less than the minimum (18") for the striking surface of a short sword.`

### Weapon Heads ###
Axes, blunt weapons, and polearms are required to have an open cell foam "head" that clearly conveys what the weapon represents. The minimum size of a weapon head is 4"x2"x2".  

### Weapon Construction ###
All weapons must have at least 5/8" of closed cell foam (ie, pipe foam, crosslinked EVA foam, etc.) completely covering the striking surface.

Thrusting tips must be at least 2" of open cell foam, and the core of the weapon must not be able to be felt through the thrusting tip. _Weapons that do not have an open cell foam thrusting cannot be used to thrust or jab!_

All weapons must have a closed cell foam pommel that completely envelopes the pommel end of the weapon core. This can be pipe foam, EVA foam, a foam fishing butt cap, or similar.

## Weapon Crafting Materials ##
* Ultralight Cores of carbon fiber, kitespar tube, fiberglass tube, or wrapped graphite tube.  Aluminum cores may only used for polearms.  Diameter should be between .414-.610".
* Closed Cell Foam.  This can be pipe foam insulation and pool noodles and is used to pad the “blade" of a boffer.  It should have a wall at least 5/8" thick.
* Open Cell Foam.  Used for boffer tips, this is a less dense foam commonly found in fabric stores as fill for pillows or in hardware stores as pipe foam.
* Kite Tape or nylon rip stop repair tape.  Preferred vendor - [FunWithWind](https://funwithwind.com/store/ListCategoriesAndProducts2.asp?idCategory=186&idparent=171)
* [Dap Weldwood Contact Cement](https://www.amazon.com/00271-Weldwood-Original-Contact-Cement/dp/B0006MXRY8/ref=pd_di_sccai_2?pd_rd_w=gdI93&pf_rd_p=c9443270-b914-4430-a90b-72e3e7e784e0&pf_rd_r=NXDNHRFGZV673SHKBQWS&pd_rd_r=377eca45-f83c-4a21-a00f-3b4859ff9ab9&pd_rd_wg=MvJFD&pd_rd_i=B0006MXRY8&psc=1)
* [EVA Foam](https://www.foambymail.com/XPE2/cross-linked-polyethylene-foam-2lb.html)
* Duct tape or strapping tape.

### Weapon Crafters
We have some players that make weapons that will sometimes coordinate with others to custom make something.  Asking in \#oog-trades-and-goods is a good place to start if you would like to go this route.

A few online storefronts will have ready made things, but please do ask others here about these places because some vendors have material and design types you will want to avoid if you want to pass weapons safety checks for most LARPs. 

## Bows and Crossbows

---
### Crossbows
The stock must be at least 12" long, and each limb must extend at least 6" from the stock (making the whole thing at least 12" wide).

If you wrap a string around the perimeter of the rep, the area it encloses must be at least 72 sq. in. (A 12" base, 12" height isosceles triangle).

If attached to your arm, you cannot use the bow while holding anything else in that hand, you cannot use the crossbow to block attacks, and you cannot attack with any melee weapons in either hand. If you want to be able to block with a shield, a weapon, or attack with a weapon, you must first remove the crossbow from your arm (or securely fold the limbs to the stock). If you are struck by any weapon, even if it does not strike the bow, you must spend at least 3 seconds roleplaying restringing the bow before you may fire it again.

The rep will be subject to a more rigorous safety inspection than a typical melee rep. It is **strongly** advised that you run your design idea past the staff before you begin construction; we would hate to see someone put a lot of time, effort, and resources into something that won't meet safety expectations.

### Quivers
The physical representation for a quiver must be at least 13" long with an opening at least 4" in diameter.  This is roughly equivalent to the size of a standard Pringles can.

Quivers may be worn anywhere on the person, so long as they are in view when you are using a Ranged Weapon that requires ammunition.

Each tagged quiver you bring into game should have its own phy rep.  A phys rep is not required for a quiver that is stored in a Pocket Dimension.

## Packets

---
* There are no type = color requirements.  However, there is a strong preference for white, as they are far easier to find.
* Wet, torn, or damaged packets should be discarded rather than returned to the NPC Camp packet bucket.
* A packet can hit you anywhere and it counts (including clothing). Weapons that strike your head, groin, or a hand holding a weapon do not count.
* When creating packets, an ideal cut size for the fabric is between 4"x4" to 6"x6".
* The approximate amount of seed inside a packet is between 1/2 tbsp to 1 tbsp depending on the type of seed you use.  The resulting packet should not be so large that it cannot fit into a standard film canister (33 mm/ 1.3 inch).
* Do not use birdseed with sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.

### Packet Crafting Materials
* **Fabric**: Cut or uncut white fabric that is a biodegradable natural fiber fabric. (Cotton, abaca, bamboo, lyocell, ramie, jute, hemp, silk.)  Please do not donate nylon, fleece, acrylic, polyester, or rayon fabrics for packets.
* **Rubber bands**: Size #32-33 is preferred (1/8"). Must be natural rubber.
* **Birdseed**: Millet bird seed or bird seed that does **not **contain sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.


## Shields

---
* The longest dimension a shield may have is 36".
* Everything attached to the shield and its edges (such as foam edging) counts as part of the shield.
* The maximum allowed surface area of a shield is 531 square inches and is calculated as if the shield were a flattened surface, counting any concavities into the silhouette.
* If a shield is curved or has three dimensions such as a partial cylinder or dome, that surface area is calculated into the total surface area.
* It is highly suggested that when making a shield rep, any fabric is detachable to prevent mold buildup.

### Shield Crafting Materials

## Physical Strikes

---
Physical strikes are weapon delivered combat effects used by characters. A physical strike is delivered once using a weapon attack, and must strike the target character successfully without being blocked in order to be a successful attack. Physical strikes are considered used whether the attack was successful or not. Physical strikes that are blocked by shields or weapons, have been blocked and are considered unsuccessful attacks. Unsuccessful physical strikes and physical strikes that have been resisted can be regained by the character resting. Physical strike effects are not magical in nature; therefore, they cannot be removed by the Dispel Magic spell or any removal skill that is limited to effects of magical origin only.

# Magic Skills

## Mastery Skills

---
A Mastery skill is purchased in order to grant a character access to a school of magic. The skill itself is the prerequisite for purchasing your first Mana Attunement of the given school, and provides a passive benefit that may be used.

| Magic Skill Costs | F   | T   | R   | S   |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Arcane Mastery    | 5   | 5   | 5   | 3   |
| Spirit Mastery    | 5   | 5   | 5   | 3   |
| Nature Mastery    | 5   | 5   | 5   | 3   |

### Arcane Mastery
This skill allows the character to Identify an item or target after 1 minute of concentration and continuous contact. This will make the nature and workings of enchantments on an item/creature known to the character, at the discretion of plot. There may be some properties that still remain hidden to the character. 


### Spiritual Mastery
This skill allows the character to briefly sense the presence of recently untethered spirits. A character skilled in Spiritual Mastery can also attempt to speak with the still tethered spirit of the recently deceased. To attempt a communication with the dead, the character must concentrate for one minute and roleplay contact with the body of the dead. While in contact with the body and still in concentration, the character may speak with the spirit of the dead. This skill does not halt the death count of the dead character and the communication immediately ends when the spirit becomes untethered.

### Nature Mastery
This skill allows the character the occasional ability to sense extreme danger, possibly even gaining temporary sight from a nearby animal in a position to warn the character. The character with the skill Natural Mastery cannot control these abilities, it is entirely up to the Plot Team to determine when the character receives these warnings and visions.


## Mana Attunement

---
In order to cast a spell, you must possess the appropriate Mastery skill, and purchase ranks of Mana Attunement. Each rank of Mana Attunement you purchase in a given school gives you 10 Points of Mana, which may be spent to cast any spell from that school, on a 1:1 basis, where Mana is equivalent to a spell rank. So after your first attunement is purchased, you could cast 10 Rank I spells, or 2 Rank V spells, or any other combination adding up to 10. These spells can be chosen on the fly, allowing for spell casters to be highly flexible. Some may prefer to Memorize their spells in advance, giving them a clearer guide on what they are capable of. If a character chooses to use Memorization, they gain a bonus 10% to their Mana Pool, so someone with a single Mana Attunement who Memorizes would have 11 Mana, or someone with 5 Attunements would have 55 Mana that they could assign to their Memorized spells.

| Attunement Cost      |  F   |  T   |   R    |    S    |     Prereqs      |
|:---------------------|:----:|:----:|:------:|:-------:|:----------------:|
| Primary Attunement   | 10+2 | 6+1  | 8+1.5  |  4+.5   | Relevant Mastery |
| Secondary Attunement | 20+4 | 12+2 |  16+3  |   8+1   | Relevant Mastery |
| Tertiary Attunement  | 30+6 | 18+3 | 24+4.5 | 12.+1.5 | Relevant Mastery |


## Return Spell Skill
>This is a magical skill that allows a character to reclaim a single SP-purchased Spell that was Resisted by their target. If the user successfully strikes an opponent with a Spell, and the Spell is then Resisted, not Reflected, the user may announce “Return”, and get the use of that spell back. This skill is expended on use.<br />Call: “Return”<br />Requires Any Mana Attunement

At the beginning of the spell, the target must clearly acknowledge the acceptance of the spell, if they do not, the spell fails to no effect. Once the spell begins, the target's body begins to immediately reform, incurring strain as per a normal resurrection. The caster must be in concentration and unimpeded for the entire casting time of this spell, else the spell will fail. If the caster’s concentration is interrupted, or the reforming body is affected by any detrimental effect, the spell fails and the target immediately suffers a second death. Prior to the casting time the player of the caster, and the player of the untethered spirit, are to verify that the spirit does not have too much strain to resurrect. A marshal should also be present to oversee the process. Once the Resurrection spell is complete, the spirit instantly reforms its body next to the spell caster. The body appears with a full health pool, and all skills renewed as if they had completed a long rest.  This is a LIFE effect. |

## Rest-Boosting Skills

---
#### Cooking
>This skill allows the character to prepare food and drink that is of higher quality than one would find on the road, or in a less expensive establishment. Using special ingredients and skills taught by grandmas across Evren, a cook can provide some benefits to those that eat their special dishes and drink their refreshing drinks.
>
>For each rank in Cooking skill, the cook may provide one of the listed benefits to food or drink, turning it into High Quality Food. The benefits may be spread across multiple items or concentrated in a single dish.
>
> Ex: A cook with 5 ranks in Cooking could make 5 items with 1 buff, an item with 3 buffs and an item with 2 buffs, or a single item with 5 buffs, or any other combination. A character partaking of High Quality Food must spend at least 5 minutes either cooking, eating, or drinking the food before the effects become active. Use of this skill does not interrupt Resting.
>
>The following benefits are available:
>- <u>Health Boost</u>:  +5 Maximum Health until Rest, can stack with itself only to +10.
>- <u>Rest Reduction</u>:  Reduce Rest Time by 15 Minutes, maximum reduction of 30 minutes per Rest.
>- <u>Restore Body</u>:  Character with a metabolism gains the effects of Restore Body:  instantly healed to their full maximum health pool and any missing or disabled limbs are restored.  Does not remove any effects.
>- <u>Return</u>:  Regain a single expended skill or spell, maximum of 2 per Rest.
>- <u>Weapon Boost</u>:  +1 Weapon Damage until Rest, can stack with itself only to +2. *Requires a Weapon Skill. Does not stack or double with any other effects or sources.*

#### Gambling
>This skill allows the character to benefit from playing games of chance. Games of chance include most gambling games such as Dragon Poker, Varos Hold Em, Black Jack, Roulette, Liar’s Dice, etc. Wagers in the games must be of some kind of valuable currency.

>Gambling speeds the recovery time of Rest. For each 5 minutes that a gambler plays, the gambler’s base Rest time of 2 hours is reduced by 15 minutes.  At 30 minutes of play, the gambler's remaining Rest time is reduced to 30 minutes. Rest time may never be lowered to less than 30 minutes.

>Gambling requires concentration. If the game stops for longer than 1 minute or the gambler suffers an attack, the game is stopped with no benefit for that 5 minute block of time.

>For each rank in Gambling that a gambler has, the gambler may benefit for one 5 minute block of time per Rest. Use of this skill does not interrupt Resting.

|Ranks|Gambling Time|Time Reduction|Rest Time|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1|5min|15min|1hr 45min|
|2|10min|30min|1hr 30min|
|3|15min|45min|1hr 15min|
|4|20min|60min|1hr|
|5|25min|75min|45min|
|6|30min|90min|30min|

#### Performing
>This skill allows other characters to benefit from a short, relaxing performance. Performances can be of a wide variety of entertaining performance arts. These include, but are not limited to, Scene Acting, Poetry Recital, Singing, Dancing, Instrumental Performance, Spoken Word, Dramatic Reading, etc. 
>
>Performances speed the recovery time of Rest. For each 5 minutes that a performer performs, the audience’s base Rest time of 2 hours is reduced by 15 minutes. Rest time may never be lowered to less than 30 minutes. To benefit from a performance, a character must be present through an entire 5 minute block of the performance. Performers should announce “Now performing!” at the beginning of each 5 minute block. This is not a requirement. 
>
>Performances require concentration. If the performer stops their performance for longer than 1 minute, or the performer suffers an attack that is NOT part of the performance, then the performance is stopped with no benefit for that block of time. 
>
>If multiple performers perform at the same time there is no increase in efficacy, however performers may alternate between one another to maintain a performance without interruption. For each rank in Performing that a performer has, the performer may benefit an audience for one block of time per Rest. Use of this skill does not interrupt Resting.

|Ranks|Performance Time|Time Reduction|Audience Rest Time|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1|5min|15min|1hr 45min|
|2|10min|30min|1hr 30min|
|3|15min|45min|1hr 15min|
|4|20min|60min|1hr|
|5|25min|75min|45min|
|6|30min|90min|30min|

## Miscellaneous Skills

---
#### First Aid
>This skill is purchased once. First Aid allows the character to provide emergency aid to a dying character. The character using First Aid will touch the downed character and say “Performing First Aid”. While First Aid is being applied, the dying count of the targeted character stops. First Aid takes a base time of 1 minute to apply. Other in-game tools can lessen this time. The character rendering First Aid is under concentration while providing the First Aid. Once the 1 minute is complete for First Aid, the downed character’s health pool is restored to 1 health point.
> 
>This skill also allows a character to touch a downed or seemingly disabled character and ask, "First Aid, what do I see?"  If the character is under an effect that is visible, the player may reply with the specific effect.

#### Escape Artist
>This skill is purchased multiple times. Each time this skill is purchased, the character may escape from magical, or non-magical bindings by completing a 3 second count of escaping the bonds. “1 I escape binding...2 I escape binding…” This skill is refreshed each Rest.

#### Trapping
 >This skill is purchased once. Trapping allows the character the chance to set a trap using the in-game trap tag, trap physical representation, and trap trigger. Setting a trap takes as long as it actually takes to set the trap. Trapping also allows the character to attempt to disarm a set trap using out of game and in-game tools. The character must actually disarm the trigger of the trap, and do so without destroying the trigger. Most disarmed traps can be saved for later use.

#### Lockpicking
>This skill is purchased multiple times. Each skill rank indicates the proficiency of the character in picking locks. To pick a lock, the character must provide their own draw bag and several beads in each of four colors. One color represents success (one bead). One color represents breaking the lock (one bead). One color represents that the character can continue the attempt (several beads), And one color represents resetting the bag (several beads). The base bag has 1 success, 1 break, 4 continue, 1 reset. The character’s skill rank is compared to the rank of the lock. For each rank that the character’s skill is under the lock, add 2 continue and 1 reset. If the character’s skill is equal to, or above the lock there is no change to the bag. The character may draw from the bag every 30 seconds until success, or the lock is broken.
> 
> Broken locks are jammed and can no longer be picked. A tinkerer must repair the broken lock before the lock can be picked again. This repair is a Rank III skill requiring 3 tinkering materials. Repairing a broken lock takes 1 minute.

#### Cutpurse
>This skill is purchased once. Cutpurse skill requires the use of Pick Pocket Tools from Tinkering. The player slips the tool onto the pouch, or pocket, and goes to notify a Game Marshal. The Game Marshal will approach the picked character and retrieve one random game item from the picked character. If there is nothing in the picked pouch, then the larceny has resulted in no reward. The transfer of goods from Game Marshal to thief takes place out of sight from other players.

#### Tracking
>This skill is purchased multiple times. Using this skill, the character can attempt to track a moving terrestrial target’s tracks. The target tracks are assigned a value according to weather, ground, recency, and skill of the target hiding their tracks. With all that taken in, the resulting modified track number is compared to the trackers number.
> 
> For every in-game hundred yards that the track is followed, the tracker can make a draw from a draw bag. The base bag is 1 success, 1 lost track, 4 continue, and 1 bag reset. For each rank above the track value, the tracker gains a success bead. For every rank below the track rank, the tracker gains 2 continue and a lost track bead. The tracker continues to draw every 30 seconds until success, or lost track is pulled. The tracking player must provide their own bead draw bag with beads or the tracking automatically fails.

## Knowledge Skills

>Knowledge skills are a way through which characters can gather information about the world around them. These skills are gained automatically as you gain SP, choosing a Profession and Hobby, with your Profession being your “main focus” and scaling faster. Once you have capped a Profession or Hobby at Rank 10, you may select a new one immediately to begin scaling, and it starts with 1 rank. A Profession goes up in rank every 50 SP, and each Hobby goes up in rank every100 SP. So you will unlock your second Profession at 450 SP, and both your Second Hobby and Third Profession at 900 SP, and so on. Each knowledge skill represents a specific area of expertise that a character can improve upon. These skills might be utilized when interacting with Plot to help you discover more information about what is happening during a particular scene, or Plot may choose to ask for Knowledge skills leading into an adventure to help flesh out what the characters might have discovered.
>
>Generally, any piece of information that you attempt to discover will be assigned a secret “Difficulty Class” by the Plot member, on a scaling slide of 1 through 10. A Difficulty Class of 1 would represent fairly common knowledge, something that most anyone who cares about the subject would know. A 10 on the other hand would represent particularly unusual or rare information, something that only a true expert in the field would have discovered. If you have enough ranks in the chosen skill to meet the difficulty class, you may learn some useful information. Having less than the set Difficulty may result in incomplete or slightly misleading information, while having more ranks than the required Difficulty may result in getting more detailed or extra information.

#### Arcane Knowledge
>Covers Arcane Magic in all its forms and uses, constructs and celestial events. Higher ranks will provide greater insight to arcane questions, or provide more detailed information on the target of your inquiry.

#### Criminal Knowledge
>Covers laws (their avoidance and subversion), various criminal organizations and their structure, cons, and illegal activity. Higher ranks will point you to contacts within some of these organizations, or reveal information you may regret knowing.

#### Economic Knowledge
>Covers trade routes, values of goods, and merchants of specific items. Higher ranks will reveal more hidden information, or let you sniff out particularly good deals.

#### Geographical Knowledge
>Covers landmarks, terrain, maps, roads, approximate distances and navigation. Higher ranks will allow for more detailed information or better navigation.

#### Historical Knowledge
>Covers recent to far flung historical events. Higher ranks will allow for knowledge of the distant past, or more accurate recollections of events.

#### Nature Knowledge
>Covers Nature Magic in all its forms and uses, beasts, plants and weather patterns. Higher ranks will provide greater insight to nature questions, or provide more detailed information on the target of your inquiry.

#### Political Knowledge
>Covers laws (their enforcement and creation), local and foreign political hierarchy, alliances and hostilities, territories and holdings. Higher ranks will reveal well-hidden information, or let you find the truth behind malicious rumors.

#### Spirit Knowledge
>Covers Spirit Magic in all its forms and uses, undead and nether spirits. Higher ranks will provide greater insight to spirit questions, or provide more detailed information on the target of your inquiry.

#### Theology Knowledge
>Covers churches, cults, religious beliefs, deities, and demigods. Higher ranks will reveal more in-depth information on various groups, or reveal hidden aspects.

# Crafting

Item production is the process by which characters are able to craft consumable items within the game system. These items make up the backbone of the game economy and help support the various skills in the game. There are five crafting skills and four material harvesting skills.

## Material Harvesting Skills 

#### Foraging
>This skill is the prerequisite for the Alchemy Skill and is used to gather the materials for it. Foraging represents the character collecting herbs, making powders, and mixing base ingredients for use in Alchemy.

#### Mining
>This skill is the prerequisite for the Smithing Skill and is used to gather the materials for it.  Mining represents the character digging out raw ore, and collecting other sundry items for use with the Smithing skill.

#### Scrapping
>This skill is the prerequisite for the Tinkering Skill and is used to gather the materials for it.  Scrapping represents the character collecting scrap metals, bits of debris, and reclaiming materials from junkyards for use with the Tinkering skill.

#### Logging
>This skill is the prerequisite for the Rune Carving Skill and is used to gather the materials for it.  Logging represents the character collecting pieces of wood and shaping them into basic shapes for wands and rune marks.

## Raw Materials
>Production materials are ranked I-V. Characters with a gathering skill will be rewarded one rank of raw material for each rank of gathering skill that they possess, per day of the event. Characters using the gathering tools from Tinkering will receive an additional raw material rank for each skill rank in gathering that they possess. Additional raw materials can be bargained for  from NPCs, or other players. Characters can also search around in-game and gather raw materials from nodes in the game.
>
>Prior to an event starting, you can spend your raw material ranks, along with any raw material tags that you have, to craft in-game items. Once you are done crafting items before the game starts, logistics will give you tags for any unspent raw materials as well as tags for the items that you produced. When you get your raw material tags, you can request to get them in any rank I-X, as long as the total ranks are equal to the unspent ranks that you have left.

## Producing Items
>Production items are ranked from I-X. It takes as many raw materials ranks to make a single item equal to the production item’s rank. But wait! Production items are ranked I-X and raw materials are only ranked I-V, and then X; how do I get VI-IX raw materials? The answer to that is to combine the I-V raw materials to equal the rank of the production item that you are making.
>
>Examples:
> 
>To make an Alchemy Rank I item, the character needs to have at least one rank in the Alchemy skill, and would use a single Rank I material. For Alchemy, this is Minor Alchemical Catalyst.
> 
> To make a Smithing Rank 8 item, the character would need at least 8 Ranks in Smithing, and could use a combination of materials where the Ranks, when added up, equal the rank of the item desired. For Smithing this could be one Iron Ore (Rank V) and three Aluminum Ores (Rank I) added up equal enough ranks to make the item.

## Durability
>Any item that is non-consumable has a Durability rating. An item’s durability is reduced by one at the beginning of every event, and when an item’s Durability reaches 0, it is no longer usable, except for Recycling, see below. A player must check in all items they intend to use or have available to use at the beginning of an event. Any item that is not checked in and has its Durability marked down, is not legal for in-game use until it has been marked by Plot. Consumable items and Materials have an effective Durability of “Until Used”, and may not be Recycled.

## Recycling Items
>An item that has been reduced to 0 Durability, destroyed by a spell or skill, or an item that a player no longer wishes to use, may be Recycled by a player with the skill. Items that are in use or activated, such as locks, may not be Recycled.  An item that is Recycled will return 1/3rd of the ranks in materials used to construct it, rounded down to a minimum of one. These materials can either be claimed for future use, or utilized immediately in the construction of a new item.

## Artificing
>Artificing is the study of the creation of magic items. Only those with at least a moderate command of each base craft can take the path of an Artificer. The creation of a magic item will vary wildly in its needs based on the item. Magic items always require materials from multiple disciplines. They also require spirit gems for the infusion of their impressive powers. All Artificers have access to a few base recipes that they may craft at will. Other items will require the development or acquisition of a Formula in order to be created. Formulas may also potentially be memorized, or even taught to others, depending on the Formula. Artificing requires 5 ranks in each production type.

## Weapon Auras
>By default, a base weapon will use Normal as its **Damage Type**.
> 
>A weapon that has been silvered may only use Silver as its **Damage Type** (ie: it can no longer swing for Normal).
>
> A weapon that has been enchanted with a Magic Aura may only swing Magic as its **Damage Type**, and cannot be silvered. If a weapon is silvered then enchanted, it also becomes a magic sword and may only swing Magic (ie, a weapon with a Magic Aura must always use Magic **Damage Type**†)
>
>A weapon may have only a single flavor or carrier enchantment (ie: a weapon cannot have both Flame Aura and Shock Aura).
>
>TL;DR: A weapon can only swing for Normal, Silver, or Magic **Damage Type**, and can only be changed by a craftsman. Additionally, a weapon may also have up to one flavor/carrier aura, which is optional in the damage call.

|Enchantments|Damage Type|Flavor/Carrier|Attack Calls|
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
|None|Normal|None|1 Normal|
|Flame Aura|Normal|Flame|1 Normal, 1 Normal Flame|
|Silvered|Silver|None|1 Silver|
|Silvered, Shock Aura|Silver|Shock|1 Silver, 1 Silver Shock|
|Magic Aura|Magic|None|1 Magic|
|Magic Aura, Stone Aura|Magic|Stone|1 Magic, 1 Magic Stone|
> 
>† _Weapon Coatings and Monstrous Auras can still be used with a weapon that has a Magic Aura._

### Weapon Coatings
>Weapon coatings are single-use alchemical products that may be applied to weapons. To apply a coating, the user must have the coating in hand and roleplay pouring or rubbing the coating on the weapon for a 5-second count. Only the character who had possession of the weapon when the coating was applied may use that coating.
>
>For example, Alice applies a Sleep Coating to her long sword then hands the sword to Bob. Bob cannot use that coating.
>
>However, if Charlie presents his sword to Diane, who then applies a Sleep Coating to Charlie's sword, then Charlie (and only Charlie) may use that Sleep Coating.
>

>Characters can purchase a Workshop from Logistics for 10 Credits. Workshops have a durability of 10, and their durability is decreased each time they are used for an event by a given character. Workshops can be used to make large-scale batches of an item, doubling the total output for a single character.
>  
>Example: If you attempt to make 10 Heal Wounds potions, this would normally take you 30 Ranks in Alchemical materials. You could either spend 15 ranks, to make 5 potions which will get doubled by the Workshop, or spend the original 30 and get 20 potions instead.  The Workshop must have a durability removed by Logistics during check-in in order to receive any batch production. More than one character may use a workshop for a given event, but each person who uses it will cost one durability.

## Artificing Products

>Artificing is a complex and daunting process that only the most dedicated of individuals dedicated to crafting can undertake. Only those with a decent grasp of all four crafting disciplines _(5 Ranks in each Skill)_ can walk the path of the Artificer, and it is this experience that will allow them to combine materials into effects that are greater than the sum of their parts, which many refer to as “Magic Items”. Artificers, like regular crafters, utilize recipes for their creations, though the recipe for a magic item is known as a Formula. All Artificers have access to a Standard Library of Formulas, which they may utilize at any time, given they have the appropriate materials to construct the desired item. Other items are known to exist, which are known as “Uncommon Formulas”, and Artificers may even attempt to invent their own, but these Formulas must first be created or discovered to utilize new and different items.

>A Magic Item will generally require the following for materials in order to be crafted. A number of materials of various kinds, with a total in material ranks equal to 10 times the Rank of the Magic Item, number of Spirit Gems equal to the Rank of the Item. All Magic Items have a 10 Durability.

>Uncommon Formulas may sometimes be Memorized or even Taught by Artificers. Formulas discovered in the world will have a notation on them indicating if they can be Memorized, and if so, how many times before the Formula is no longer functional. They may also have a notation for how many times a Formula may be Taught after being Memorized, if it may be Memorized at all. If an Uncommon Formula is not capable of being Memorized, or the Artificer does not wish to Memorize it, then when attempting to create the item the Formula must be shown to Logistics before the item tag will be produced.

>Presented here are the Standard Library of Items, as well as any items known to the world at large as “Uncommon Formulas”, for which the Formula may be discovered or re-invented,

# Ritual Magic

## About Ritual Magic

---
Ritual Magic is the way through which an individual attempts to weave the powers of themselves or greater beings to affect incredible and often long-lasting effects upon the world. A Ritualist is someone who is trained in these magics and in the art of channeling them to achieve their desired goals.

A Ritual is the act through which a Ritualist attempts to conduct these magics, and each Ritualist’s method for enacting a Ritual is different, though there are a few generally agreed upon elements that must be achieved in order for a Ritual to succeed. Firstly, a Ritual must last at least 5 minutes in order for success to be achieved. It has been said that in times of great need a Ritualist can attempt to end the Ritual earlier than this, but they risk Failure at best, horrible Backlash at worst. Secondly, a Ritual must contain a persistent visual or auditory element. Some Ritualists chant, sing, or recite scripture of their Deity. Others may choose to draw or cast Runes, dance, or create art as a focus for their magic. All that matters is that these elements are consistent throughout the Ritual, without long lapses or interruptions. Third, the Ritualist must provide a source of Power other than their own for the ritual, often in the form of Spirit Gems, a number of which must be provided equal to the Rank of the Ritual. Lastly, and most importantly, the Ritualist must have the Ritual Scroll open and accessible to them at all times during the Ritual, even if they do not need to actively gaze upon it. If the Ritual Scroll is not present, or if during the Ritual it is removed or hidden from the Ritualist, the Ritual will fail. These four elements are commonly referred to as the “Fundamental Four Elements” of Rituals, without which a Ritual is all but doomed to failure.

There are other ways through which a Ritualist may enhance their casting and thus the odds of success. A few of the more commonly accepted methods are as follows. First, the inclusion of further Ritual props, themed appropriately for the Ritual being attempted, though some Rituals may require specific props to be present to even be cast at all. Secondly, secondary Ritualists who can aid in the focusing and channeling of the magic, and even non-Ritualists whose nature or actions are particularly in-tune with the desired outcome of the Ritual may aid in its success. Some Ritualists opine that at their core, Rituals are a Performance for the Gods, and as such, the more devoted the casters are to providing a grand spectacle, the more likely the Gods are to look upon their attempts with favor and grant their desires. Conversely, if the participants in the Ritual are clearly out of sync, underprepared, or otherwise break the flow of the ritual, the Gods are more likely to punish the attempt.

There exists for Ritualists a “Standard Library” of Rituals, of which all Ritualists have access to at all times, as they are capable of producing a new scroll  for these Rituals from Memory. Rituals outside of this Library must be acquired through diligent research or through discovery in the world at large. Scrolls for Rituals outside the Standard Library may have the potential to be Memorized or even Taught, with each Scroll indicating how many times, if at all, it may be Memorized, and subsequently if it can be Taught and how often. Once Memorized, a Scroll is considered part of that Ritualist’s Standard Library. If a Ritual is not part of the Ritualist’s Standard Library, they must have the exact scroll to perform the Ritual, and this must be shown to Plot before Ritual can begin. If a Ritualist wishes to Memorize a Scroll, they must do so by showing the Scroll to Plot, so Plot can note their Character Sheet and the Scroll appropriately. For any Ritual in the Standard Library, a Ritualist must still have a Scroll representation during the Ritual, following all normal rules, they simply do not need the tagged Scroll item.

For Base Standard Library (not Memorized) Rituals, only the Fundamental Four Elements need to be achieved in order to guarantee success. For all others, it is recommended that further aspects be added, as with each increase in a Ritual’s level, the odds of success decrease. It is claimed that a Ritualist who attempts to cast a Ritual of exactly their Ranks in Ritual Magic using only the Fundamental Four Elements, they have at best a 60% chance of success. Higher Ranks in Ritual Magic, use of Props, secondary Casters, or other Participants can help increase these odds. Similarly, poor performance, inappropriate props or participants, or disjointed or disharmonic casting may decrease the odds of success, and invite potential Backlash.

A Ritual has 4 Possible Outcomes. First is Success. This indicates that the Ritual has succeeded as intended, and the desired effect has been achieved without further incident. Second is a Flaw. This means that the Ritual has completed, but often with a side-effect of some kind, with varying degrees of severity. Third is a Failure. This indicates that the Ritual failed, with no further effects, but any Spirit Gems or other consumable materials used in the Ritual are still consumed. Last, and most feared, is a Backlash. This indicates that the Ritual not only Failed, but a severe negative effect has occurred, up to and including Death of the Caster or Participants, and just as a Failure, any Spirit Gems or materials are still consumed.

Following are the Standard Library, and other Rituals for which the Scroll must be discovered or re-invented.

## Standard Library

---
### Rank I

#### Elemental Shift
>This ritual removes “Magic Missile” as an option for an arcane magic user at every level it is offered and replaces them with one of either:
> * Flame Bolt - “I conjure a flame bolt &lt;number>.”
> * Frost Bolt - “I conjure a frost bolt &lt;number>.”
> * Shock Bolt - “I conjure a shock bolt &lt;number>.”
> * Acid Bolt  -  “I conjure a stone bolt &lt;number>.”

>The target of this ritual chooses the element at the end of the ritual casting. This change is permanent until this ritual is once again cast on the target at which time a different element, or “Magic Missile” may be selected. 

>This ritual requires that the ritualist use a physical representation for each of the four elements: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. 

>Note: This spell does not affect the Rank I “Mana Bolt” spell.

#### Create Spirit Familiar
>This ritual siphons off a portion of the character's spirit, creating the physical form of a Spirit Familiar. The form of the Spirit Familiar is left up to the player with the final approval of the local Plot Team.

>Once the ritual is complete, the Spirit Familiar will take shape and be with the character at all times. The familiar is an in game spirit that only the character can communicate with, even though the Spirit Familiar is visible to everyone. The Spirit Familiar cannot be affected by physical or spell attacks of any kind, including weapon or packet delivered effects, nor can it be used as a shield to protect the character from them.

>The character may then procure further spirit rituals to begin a transformation process where the character casts a base “Spirit Transform to &lt;x>” ritual upon the Spirit Familiar, and subsequently casts empowerment rituals known as Transform Ability Rituals, based on the transformation of the Spirit Familiar. These empowering rituals allow the character to invest skill points on Transform skills.

>If at any time a character no longer wishes to pursue the path of their current Spirit Familiar, they may elect to have a new Spirit Familiar ritual cast upon them. However, this does not come without cost. The Spirit Familiar’s link to the character’s spirit is strong, and breaking it can be harmful. Upon casting a new Spirit Familiar, all previously unlocked Transform Abilities are lost, and the character permanently loses 50 SP. 

>This ritual requires that the target character have a pre-approved physical representation of their Spirit Familiar with them in the ritual.

### Rank II

#### Dampen Magic
>The caster attempts to extend their will to create an area that prevents the use of or casting of ritual magic - except for Destroy Ritual Magic.  If successful, the area will have a radius of 100ft that persists for 1 hour.  May only be destroyed by a Destroy Ritual Magic ritual.

### Rank III

#### Race Change
>The caster specifies a target to reshape its spirit of a race chosen by the caster. If the ritual succeeds the target is changed to the targeted race and gains the racial traits of the selected race, whilst losing those of the original. (Plot effects such as Awakened neck collars are preserved) A target may not be affected by a Race Change against its will.
#### Purify/Corrupt The Land
>The caster reaches out and taps into the primordial energy of the surrounding environment to either purify it of dark taint or call upon the fiends to spread their necrotic tendrils into the land. The size of surrounding land affected is 10x the caster’s ritual magic level.

### Rank IV

#### Spirit Lock
>This ritual forms a permanent bond between a specific item and a target individual This bond transcends the physical realm, ensuring that no matter where the individual may go, the item will always follow. As long as the item endures, it is Locked to the target, unable to be stolen, given away, or even used by another individual. If the target should die and their spirit departs to seek resurrection, the item will follow them. This does not grant any extra resilience for the item, and the effect will fade if the item is destroyed or expires.
#### Magical Barrier
>This ritual is designed to imbue the participants with additional magical shielding. Each target that actively participates in the casting of the ritual gains a single use of Resist Magic that lasts for one day or until used.

### Rank V

#### Spirit Forge
>The caster reaches into the very essence of the target and gives the target a glimpse into the infinite multitude of possibilities posed by their history and growth. This spell allows the target to instantly choose to change their chosen class, and/or re-assign all assigned Skill Points they possess.

### Rank VI

#### ?

### Rank VIII

#### Destroy Ritual Magic
>The caster attempts to focus their mastery of ritual magic in order to destroy any Ritual Magic effect. The difficulty of this spell is variable based on the level of the effect the caster is attempting to destroy. It is highly recommended that anyone undertaking this Ritual prepare thoroughly and do everything in their power to boost their chance of success, as any magic that might require such an intervention is likely to prove difficult to Destroy.

### Rank IX

##### ?

### Rank X

#### Empower Spirit
>The ritualist empowers a character with grand energies of might and magic. This ritual channels the energies of the consumed Spirit Gems directly into the target character, granting them incredible resilience to face an upcoming challenge. The target gains 2x Resist Physical and 2x Resist Spell, and an intangible suit of 50 Armor that cannot be refit by any means, but stacks over any worn armor and bypasses normal Armor Caps. These last until expended, the target resurrects, or 24 hours have passed. A character may be empowered in this way no more than once per week.

### Rank V

#### Spirit Familiar Transformation
This ritual is designed to empower and shape the powers of the target’s Spirit Familiar, which in turn will help guide the target down the Path of Power of the creature they wish to emulate. A Spirit Familiar Transformation scroll will have a specific type of creature listed for the Transformation. After the Ritual has been cast, the Target will be provided a list of available Transform Abilities that they can pursue the relevant Transform Ability Ritual Scrolls for, and once those have been cast, they will gain access to those as purchasable skills, until such time as their Spirit Familiar is replaced. A Spirit Familiar that has been subject to a Spirit Familiar Transformation cannot receive a different Transformation. If an individual wishes to change their chosen Creature, they must cast a new Spirit Familiar, losing all currently unlocked Transform Abilities, and incurring the usual SP loss for changing Spirit Familiars.

At casting, the player assigns an amount of skill points taken from the character, up to a maximum 50% of the character's total skill points. These skill points are deducted from the character's total skill points and placed into a skill point pool for the Spirit Familiar that may be used to purchase unlocked Transform Abilities.


The player may transfer more skill points from the character to the Spirit Familiar between events, but the Spirit Familiar may never have more than 50% of the character's total maximum skill points. The skill points allocated to the Spirit Familiar cannot be reclaimed by the character unless a new Spirit Familiar or Spirit Forge ritual is cast.


Upon the permanent death of the character, the Spirit Familiar will die, returning the stored Skill Points to the character, and bestowing the full transformation power to the character. The character will become an optional NPC available to the local Plot Team.

### Rank VI

#### Summon Entity
The caster attempts to call forth a being from beyond. The being, if summoned, can interact only with the caster for x min’s = the casters ritual magic level. The being can be that of a spirit that has been long deceased, a creature of the dark nether, or some other extraplanar entity known to the caster.

### Rank VII

#### Spirit Bottle
The caster places the majority of their spirit within the confines of a specially prepared Crystal Bottle. This process helps protect the spirit from the strain of leaving their mortal coil. The next time the Caster reaches 0 body within 24 hours, their body immediately crumbles and their spirit returns to the Spirit Bottle to regenerate a body with no increase in Strain. If the Bottle has been destroyed at the time they attempt to regenerate, the spirit must seek resurrection as normal, including accruing Strain.

### Rank VIII

#### Improve Aether Flow
The ritualist creates an area of improved Aether flow that will enhance the speed of Rest. This area must be a clearly defined 10 foot radius circle. The border of the area provides no protection or other benefits other than aiding Rest. 

The Resting area will last for 5 days. Within the area, for each 15 minutes of time that a character Rests within the area, their maximum Rest time will be reduced by 30 minutes. Rest time cannot be reduced to below 30 minutes. 
      
This ritual requires that the ritualist provide a relaxing environment for the characters that are resting.

### Rank IX

#### ?

### Rank X

#### Transformation to &lt;Creature>
A ritual that grants the target the imbuement of a powerful spirit that remains dormant most of their lives. Only in times of great danger or crisis will this spirit emerge and grant it’s host strength to try and persevere.

A Scroll of Transformation to &lt;Creature> will have a specific creature type listed, and may not be used for any other Creature type. These scrolls can never be Memorized or Taught. Once cast, this Ritual is Permanent unless subject to a Destroy Ritual Magic

This ritual requires either at least a single Spirit Gem filled with a fragment of the creature the target wishes to embody, or the blessing and participation of a creature of the indicated type. 

The effects of Transformation are entirely at Plot discretion, upon receiving a Transformation you will be given a Stat Card for what effects and abilities you will receive should the Transform ever activate. These Transformations are often more powerful than a Spirit Familiar, but due to their infrequent activation, they are often less sought after. 

This ritual acts in opposition to a Spirit Familiar, and someone who has a Spirit Familiar may not have a Transformation, and vice-versa.

Upon the permanent death of the character, if the character has a Transformation effect on their spirit, they will rise as an optional NPC available to the local Plot Team with the full transformation power of the character.

# Necromancy Update

## Definition:

---
Necromancy is referred to as a branch of Spirit Magic primarily focused on the creation, preservation, and manipulation of undead creatures. This includes any spell where the incant begins with _“Fiends of the Dark Nether…”_, and creates, animates, heals, or controls undead specifically.

## Synopsis:

---
* Animate undead without making yourself vulnerable to Dark Fiends.
* Only works on permanently dead bodies that have also been specially prepared.
* Corpses may be animated repeatedly, by different casters, though they need to be prepared and possibly repaired between animations.
* “Renting” a corpse from the Necromancer’s Guild of Varos requires a Necromancy License.

## Historical Necromancy and Its Current Function:

---
The current understanding of Necromancy and its associated magics is that each invocation of a Necromantic spell leaves the caster’s spirit open and vulnerable to corruption by these Fiends, as the caster is borrowing their power to complete the spell.

Over time, this can lead to the necromancer losing themselves as their Spirit degrades, becoming vulnerable to being completely possessed by a Dark Fiend seeking to escape their imprisonment from within the Dark Nether.

As the caster is relying on powers outside of their own mana to assist in the control, creation, and manipulation of the undead, the only limit to the number of undead that can be raised by a single Necromancer is the magnitude of their magical attunement. Fiendish Necromancy is also potent enough to overtake any remaining connection between a body and its spirit while it is weakened by death, and force the body to act according to the caster’s will. This can prevent a Spirit from undergoing a cycle of Death and Resurrection, which has led to the argument that Necromancy disrupts the natural order of Life and Death.


## New Necromancy and Its Function:

---
The focus of this new research has been to eliminate the need for a necromancer to call upon external forces, such as Fiends of the Nether, when animating a body thus eliminating the risk of corruption. Rather than borrowing the power of a Fiend to possess and animate a target, the caster themself acts as a puppeteer of a spiritless corpse by infusing the target with their own mana to act as a replacement for the departed Spirit.

This means that “Traditional”_(aka, Fiendish)_ Necromantic practices still exist, but this method can allow for a caster to perform some spells of similar function without the risk to their person or others.

### Restrictions:

Unfortunately, research into this new branch of Necromancy is still ongoing and an individual caster is not yet able to meet the same level of power as a caster calling upon the Fiends might be able to achieve.

1. This method may ONLY be used on targets who are permanently dead, ie, the body of a person whose spirit has crossed into the Eternal Graveyard and thus cannot return from their final Rest. As the caster is the sole source of magic for the reanimation of a body, this means that the caster cannot contend with external forces acting upon the target body, such as a still tethered Spirit attempting to return to it. This means the animated corpse retains no memories of its previous life, nor does it possess the ability to recall information from previous reanimations.
2. The concentration required to maintain the body’s reanimation means a necromancer can only animate one target at a time for a limited duration before they must rest to cast the spell again. If the spell is disrupted, or the body is damaged to the point of being unable to carry out commands, the caster must rest before attempting to reanimate the body again.
3. The corpse must also undergo a specialized method of preparation prior to being animated via this method. Without this preparation, the necromancer will not be able to anchor upon the corpse the magics that allow for the body to be animated according to the caster’s will. This is the final reason a found corpse, or newly dead body is unable to be raised and reanimated using this method.


### Benefits:

While this style of Necromancy may be seen as less powerful on the surface, it does have several benefits that the previous method lacks. 

1. This method DOES NOT work on individuals that were not previously willing to allow for their body to be used in such a manner and does not affect the cycle of Life and Death, as it requires the Spirit to have crossed to the Eternal Graveyard.
2. Fiendish Necromancy overwhelmingly leads to the creation of an undead creature that is weaker than the necromancer raising it. , This new method can allow for bodies of varying strength and skill to be preserved to some degree and reanimated by a caster of minimally sufficient skill, regardless of the overall strength of the reanimated body.
3. Undead raised by Fiendish means had little to none of their abilities they possessed while alive, unless raised by significantly powerful necromantic means. This method can allow for some skill and ability previously possessed by the body to be retained, though death does appear to diminish the overall ability the individual once possessed while alive.
4. Undead created by calling upon the Fiends of the Dark Nether seem to have an extremely limited duration that they can function before they are unable to continue acting according to the will of the caster. Bodies reanimated using this newly developed method do not crumble or otherwise become unusable at the conclusion of the spell. Additionally, the duration of their ability to stay animated and under the control of the necromancer is significantly longer than previous known animation spells.
5. Animated Undead are also beholden to the master that raised them, though other powerful undead may also be able to control them. Bodies reanimated using this new method are not rendered unusable upon the conclusion of the spell. When the animation magic expires, or if the undead corpse is reduced to 0 body, the corpse should be brought back to the Necromancer’s Guild of Varos, where it will be made ready to be animated again.


## Reanimation Process:

---
In order for a body to be suitable for reanimation, it has been mentioned it must undergo several steps to be suitable for use following an individual’s final death:


### Preparation:

1. Prior to death, an individual must give their **uncoerced** consent that their body may be utilized following their final death. This process is handled via a signed contract that the individual may cancel at any time should they find they have a change of heart or other circumstances arise. All contracts will be kept on file within the Necromancer’s Guild, specifying the duration of time the body will be maintained until its final burial, and any wishes of the individual in regards to their remains following the conclusion of their contract.

   Further steps in the process ensure that unwillingness or coercion on behalf of the individual will clash with the magics that allow for reanimation and the body will not animate. This is to ensure that EVERY body employed in this manner were willing volunteers.

2. The living individual is subject to a specialized ritual that creates a unique magic circle that acts as a “signature” or imprint of the individual’s Spirit. This imprint contains the sum of their skills and abilities and allows the body and caster to utilize those abilities

   even after their death. This circle is sealed and kept on record with their contract, but is unable to be used until the individual endures their final death, as it is only compatible with their body bearing no tethered Spirit.

3. Upon the individual’s permanent death, the created magic circle is affixed permanently to the body to act as a conduit for the eventual link between the body and caster during the process or reanimation. The body is treated to ensure the progression of decay is prevented, though it is possible that during the process of imprinting the body may be deemed more suitable to undergo a period of decomposition for one reason or another, prior to its first reanimation.

### Reanimation:

Only individuals granted a license to practice Necromancy by the Necromancer’s Guild of Varos are allowed access to these prepared bodies, though they are available at any time for members who remain in good standing with the Guild and Kingdom.

Members may select from any available body and will place a deposit on hold with the Guild to be returned when the body is returned at the end of the reanimation period. **Failure to return the body for <span style="text-decoration:underline;">any</span> reason will result in a forfeiture of the deposit. **All funds go toward the continued maintenance of the bodies in the Guild’s care, preparation of incoming bodies, and funerary services for the bodies at the conclusion of their contract.

Members will be presented with information relevant to each body to assist in their decision to select one suitable for their current needs. Once a selection is made, the caster must perform a short ritual which includes the phrase, _“Empty Vessel, Arise Once More and Serve Me.”_

Should the body be properly prepared, the circle will activate and the body will reanimate and follow the caster’s commands. casters will gain an innate knowledge of all of the body’s abilities upon the establishment of the link.

Reanimated bodies will follow short, simple commands such as:

- _“Defend me.”_

- _“Attack anything wearing a green shirt”_

-	_“Guard this spot.”_

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but an example of the types of commands that could be given to a reanimated body.

The animation will last for approximately two hours after reanimation or the duration of one adventure module, at which time the body will become unresponsive and unable to be reanimated until it has been returned to the guild. The caster will be unable to animate another corpse until they complete a rest.


## Spells and Legality:

---
**_<u>ALL forms of Necromancy, undead, and reanimated bodies are still illegal within Varos’ city boundaries, regardless of a Necromancer’s Guild of Varos license, and will be punished in accordance with Kingdom Law.</u>_**

All spells with the incantations that include “Fiends of the Dark Nether” are still highly dangerous to the caster and considered ILLEGAL. Any caught using such spells will be punished according to Kingdom Law.


## Out of Game Information:

---
### NPCs:

To help alleviate strain on the Plot Team, Players who wish to reanimate a body will need to provide their own NPC. Players will <u>not</u> be given a stat card for their reanimated body until the NPC is present, and the reanimation timer will “begin” upon the Player and NPC leaving the Necromancer’s Guild. (Time spent waiting to begin a mod will not count toward this timer)

NPCs volunteering for this role are allowed to stop at any time, regardless of the duration left before the repped body becomes unresponsive, though this is discouraged if not for medical reasons or discomfort with the current ongoing plot.

NPCing in this manner may count toward a player’s NPC shift, though this will be determined on a case-by-base basis.


### Stat Cards:

Players will be given short descriptions correlating to the “available” bodies and may vary from day-to-day or event-to-event depending on In Game activities. Descriptions could contain information such as the body’s former name, occupation, notable accomplishments, and other relevant details.

No actual stats will be revealed until a body is selected and reanimated, at which time the Player and NPC will be given the relevant stat card to use for the duration of the spell. If the

Player does not find the reanimated body suitable for their needs, they are free to end the reanimation spell early, but must still complete a rest before making another selection.


### Combat:

Reanimated bodies are intrinsically linked to the will of their caster. While verbal commands are needed to control a reanimated body, NPCs must follow all given commands to the best of their abilities, until a new command is given or they complete the task given to them. At no time may an NPC deliberately misinterpret a caster’s orders.

Unless otherwise specified by the stat card, all reanimated bodies:

* Cannot run in direct sunlight
* Will not defend themselves unless ordered to, or currently engaged in combat
* Have no metabolism

If a caster is unable to give verbal commands, such as under the effects of a _Silence_ spell, the NPC must wait until the caster is again able to command them.

If an NPC reaches 0hp, the spell reanimating them is broken, regardless of any time remaining on the spell. The NPC will give the caster their stat card and must then inform the Plot Team leading the mod (once it is safe/prudent to do so) that they are no longer animated. At which point they may join the mod NPCs or return to town to resume their character’s activities. If the body is destroyed or unable to be retrieved for some reason, the NPC may be required to hand over their stat card to the Plot Team instead.

Once this occurs, it is the responsibility of the caster to decide how to roleplay what is done with the body. For example, if they decide to carry the body with them, they must roleplay carrying the body’s dead weight, picking it up, and setting it down when appropriate.

### Returning a Body:

Players using a body maintained by the Necromancer’s Guild are to return the body following the conclusion of the mod, as bringing a reanimated body into Varos may have unintended consequences for the Player.

To return the body, the Player (with or without the NPC) must return the stat card to the Necromancy Guild. They will then be given back their deposit, and be able to utilize the Guild’s services again once their rest is complete.

Failure to return a body will result in the forfeiture of the deposit, and may result in the loss of Guild privileges.


# Life & Death

## Body _(aka Health Points)_

---
Body is the measurement of a character’s state of health, and is often referred to as “Health Points” or “Hit Points” in many RPG systems. All characters start with 10 Body, and gain more via the Toughness skill. Receiving any amount of Damage reduces your Current Body. You can receive healing effects to increase your Body after taking Damage, but healing may never put you above your Maximum Body.


## Alive

---
Any character with 1 or more Current Body is “**Alive**.”


## Unconscious

---
A character whose Current Body is exactly 0 is considered **Unconscious**. A character who is Unconscious is unable to take any actions that require active thought or movement, and the character is considered helpless. Being **Unconscious **lasts for 5 minutes, at the end of which time the character is returned to consciousness with 1 Body. If a character takes any additional damage while at 0 and **Unconscious**, they proceed to begin **Bleeding Out**.


## Bleeding Out (aka Dying)

---
A character who has their Current Body reduced to -1 is considered **Bleeding Out**. A character cannot be reduced to below -1 Body, regardless of the amount of damage taken.

**Bleeding Out** lasts for 1 minute, during which the character is unconscious and may not make any game actions that require consciousness. Any amount of healing will restore the character’s Body by the amount stated by the healing effect, and they will no longer be **Bleeding Out**.

Receiving First Aid will pause the dying count until the First Aid is completed or the character performing the First Aid is interrupted, at which point the **Dying** character will either be at 0 body, **Unconscious**, or their **Bleeding Out** count will resume at its previous count.

After 1 minute of **Bleeding Out**, the character dies and is now **Dead**.

_(Ex: Bob is **Bleeding Out**. Thirty seconds into **Bleeding Out**, Charlie heals Bob for 10 Health Points. Bob is now conscious, able to act again, and has 9 current Health Points.)_


## Dead

---
A character that goes 1 minute of **Bleeding Out** without receiving any healing or First Aid, or who is affected by some other Death effect, becomes **Dead**.

**Death lasts for 5 minutes**, at which point, the character’s body dissipates, their spirit departs and travels to a **Shrine of Resurrection. **Any in-game items the character possesses when they dissipate are dropped to the ground, the player puts on a white headband and goes Out-Of-Game, and should seek out a marshal (either the marshal of the mod, or NPC camp) to seek resurrection.

While **Dead**, a character is not aware of their surroundings, and may not make any game actions, move, speak, be affected by any effect that reduces or heals Body Points, or be affected by any effect that does not specifically target **Dead** bodies.

During the 5 minutes the character is **Dead**, if they receive a Life spell or Revivify spell, they become **Alive** as per the spell they receive _(ie, Life will restore the character’s Current Body to their Maximum Body, Revivify will restore the character to **Alive** but **Unconscious** at 0 body)_.


## Spirits

---
The spirit of a character is the essence of that person. Spirits are always Out Of Game, and may not interact with or be aware of the In-Game world, and In Game characters may only interact with spirits within a Shrine of Resurrection or while under an effect that explicitly states that they may do so.


## Resurrection

---
A character who has passed their 5 minute **Death** count dissipates, and their spirit will depart to seek **Resurrection**. If the spirit, as an Out-of-Game decision, believes that an ally may come and attempt to **Resurrect** them using the Rank IX Spirit Spell Resurrection, then they may linger for a time. If they do not, then the spirit will depart it’s current location to seek the nearest safe **Shrine of Resurrection.** The knowledge of whether or not a specific Shrine is “Safe” is entirely OOG knowledge, but a Spirit will never **Resurrect** at an unsafe Shrine. When a Spirit **Resurrects**, they will accrue **Strain**, explained below.

Any player may choose to have their character dissipate at any time, for any reason, and then immediately seek resurrection.


## Strain

---
**Strain** is described as what happens when a spirit is pushed beyond its normal limits. For many, their Spirit will never incur any **Strain**, yet for Adventurers, **Strain** is an all-too-common occurrence. The most common way of acquiring strain is through the process of Resurrection. Whenever a character Resurrects, they gain Two points of **Strain** on their Spirit.

While a Spirit has any **Strain**, they are unable to incorporate new experiences, and as such, a character with **Strain** cannot spend any accumulated Skill Points until their **Strain** is reduced to 0. A Spirit recovers from **Strain** by experiencing new things. For every event a Character attends, they reduce any **Strain** on their Spirit by 1, including in an event where they Resurrect.

A few points of **Strain** can be carefully managed, but anyone who accrues too many should begin thinking of their own safety first. If at any point a Character should attempt to Resurrect with 10 or more points of **Strain** however, they fail to Resurrect, and are now **Permanently Dead**.


## Permanent Death

---
A character who is **Permanently Dead** may no longer be returned to life by any means. The Player of a **Permanently Dead** character may then roll 50% of the accumulated SP of the **Permanently Dead** character into a new Character, plus the base 100 SP for a new character.


## Killing Blow

---
Killing Blow is a 3-count that can be interrupted. When Killing Blowed, the target becomes **Dead**. _Killing Blow 1, Killing Blow 2, Killing Blow 3 &lt;type>_.  The target of a killing blow may refuse it, so long as they are capable of movement.  Any killing blow is assumed to automatically be refused by a target capable of movement, unless explicitly accepted by the target.


## Dismemberment & Body Smuggling

---
A character whose body has been dismembered while **Bleeding Out  or Dead** may still be healed or revived. The part of the character that can be so affected is represented by and located wherever the player of that character is. The spirit-containing body of a character may be carried by another character, however, the person carrying the body may not run or move faster than the player of the character being carried.

Dismembering a character for the purpose of attempting to use a smaller body part to heal, revive, or even hide the character is not any different than if the character were not dismembered. If a character is **Bleeding Out **or** Dead **and someone wishes to bring that character to a healer, or move the body away from where it fell, they may role-play carrying the body by picking it up on a three count _(ex: “One I pick you up… Two I pick you up… Three I pick you up…”)_ and carrying it elsewhere. The carrying player may not run, and both players must roleplay maintaining contact and remain within arm’s reach of each other. If any effect would forcibly move the carrier away at a pace faster than a walk, or would otherwise render them unable to hold game items in their hands, the character must drop the body on a One Count _(ex: “One I drop you”)_ and may only resume carrying them on a new three count.


# Resting

## Resetting Skills and Magic Items

---
Adventurers are powerful individuals who rely on magic and skill to defeat their enemies. This expenditure of endurance both physically and magically takes a toll on even the most mighty of heroes on Evren. Magic items store Aether to power their wondrous magic, even the most powerful of artifacts requires time to recharge its Aether stores. 

There are two periods of time on Evren when skills and magic items can be recharged and used again. The first is Rest, the second is Day.

## Rest

---
Rest is a short period of time that the character takes to relax and recharge their personal Aether stores of energy required to use the magical and martial skills that the character has learned. Rest has a maximum duration of two hours, and a minimum duration of 30 minutes. Several items and skills in game can be used by the character to reduce their Rest time. You may also choose to NPC during your character’s Rest time for more game rewards! 

Resting requires that the character take a break from adventuring for a period of time. During Rest, the character may not use skills, and may not run. If the character does any of these things the Rest ends. The character is focused on letting their body absorb the ambient Aether in the area to restore their energy. 

Resting can be stopped by the character at any time. If the character’s health pool is damaged, or if the character suffers death, the Rest will also be stopped. Once the Rest is stopped, the character must restart the Rest from the beginning. 

Once the Rest is complete, the character will have all their Magic Spell and Martial Skills returned to them for another use. Any effects that have a duration of Rest become expired on the character. 


## Per Day

---
Magic items, production skills, and some effects recharge or expire at the end of the day. This time occurs at 6pm (out of game) each day. This happens automatically, and is not considered a Rest period.


# NPCs & Benefits

## What is a NPC?

---
A NPC is a Non-Player Character.  In most game systems, this is a fictional character that cannot be played or controlled by a real-world person.  In LARP, every character is controlled by a real-world person, but for us, NPC means that this person is an extension of the plot team.  They are playing a character, a monster, serving as a Ritual Marshal, Game Marshal, or directing a mod for characters.  NPCs might be as simple as a town guard, a wild wolf, a giant beetle, a merchant with exclusive wares, or even a rich noble!

At Chronicles, we LOVE when people volunteer to NPC, because those volunteers help us bring stories to life!  NPCing is also a great way to get a crash course through game systems like combat and magic and explore putting on a new personality.

## What does a NPC do?

---
Most often, a NPC will be asked to assist a Plot member with a mod or story event.  Some of the tasks they might have include dressing up, putting on creature make-up, and serving as a mob or monster meant to challenge the player characters (PCs) on a particular mob.  A NPC might also be what is commonly called a "crunchie".  These are monsters that are often minor or weaker and will directly invade the town or pick off PCs that have wandered off unsafely alone.

Some other tasks may be helping to organize and clean NPC camp, making spell packets, running small mods on their own as a particular kind of NPC such as a merchant, a thief, or a gambler.   NPCs may also be asked to act as a mod-runner for a small group.  This last option is usually only asked of NPCs that have shown they have interest in doing so and have the trust of the plot team to make it a fun experience for the PCs.

## NPC Shifts

---
First, let’s start by identifying the two kinds of NPCs:

A **Part Time NPC** is someone that volunteers for a full shift at least one day of the event.  Part Time NPCs also play their characters during the event.  For a Part Time NPC, a full shift is **three hours**.  A Part-Time NPC may work as many hours in a single day as they like.  Each three hour shift is counted as a completed shift.  Rewards can be claimed on a "one shift per single event day" basis.  
>For example, in a three day event, a three hour shift on Friday, six hour shift on Saturday, and a three hour shift on Sunday only counts as three full shifts for the Skill Point or Goblin Point reward.  Because it’s a three day event, that particular reward can only be claimed three times.  Mystery Sacks may be claimed for EVERY completed three hour shift.

A **Full Time NPC** is someone that serves as a NPC for the entire event.  They do not play their character at all during the event.  For a Full Time NPC, a full shift is the number of days in an event, which may be two or three.  To be a Full Time NPC, you must coordinate with Plot ahead of an event.

## Double-Hooking, the Plot Queue, and NPC Shifts

---
Double-hooking is a term used for when two groups of PCs are waiting on Plot for a particular mod and are either asked by Plot or agree Out Of Character (OOC) for each group to serve as NPCs for the other group’s mod.  When it comes to the plot team’s queue, these groups are very likely to be taken ahead of others because less preparation for handling NPC logistics for a given mod may become much easier when you have two groups ready.

In general, participating in a double-hook does not count towards a Part-Time NPC shift; however, in rare circumstances, such as double-hooking in a mod that runs for the length of a normal Part-Time NPC shift or more, Plot has full discretion to credit you with a completed shift.  If you have already completed a shift that day, be sure to clarify what rewards you are gaining, because you might be limited to partial or you may get everything.


## NPC Rewards

---
Aside from the shiny feel-good emotions of having helped out your chapter, Chronicles also gives those that volunteer as NPCs rewards in several forms!  <i>(Please note that while Plot and Staff are likely to have water and snacks at NPC camp, meals at the Tavern are not free to NPCs unless specifically stated by the player running the tavern.)</i>

## How Do I Claim Mystery Sacks?

---
Mystery Sacks can be claimed at the end of your NPC Shift with any staff or plot person or by emailing `plot@larpchronicles.com` and requesting it as part of your Production Request for the next game.


# Goblin Points

## Goblin Points - What Are They?

---
Goblin Point (GP) is a type of Out-Of-Character (OOC) currency in Chronicles.  They can be obtained by donation of time, such as event clean-up and NPC shifts or donation of items, such as packets, props, or supplies from the Chronicles Wishlist.  GP can be spent on a variety of things such as crafting materials, death forgiveness, and even Skill Point catch up for missed events.


## How Do I Get Goblin Points?

---
Goblin Points are awarded from plot and/or staff for contributions, donations, and assistance given.  They have a rough equivalent of 10 GP per $1 USD of value; however, you may not purchase them with direct cash donations.  There are special circumstances where this rate is increased.  You should always check with the plot team and/or staff about any special chapter needs!

## Getting the Most Out of Goblin Points

---
From time to time, the chapter may need some things more than others.  When this is true, specific listings will be tagged as “Needed” or “Critically Needed.”  These tags mean that the normal GP awarded for them is increased.

* **“Needed” Items.** These are items that if we do not receive or maintain on a semi-regular basis would impact the game quality significantly. Examples include: Packets, weapons, and tabards.
* **“Critically Needed” Items.**  These are items that are in an immediate need in order to continue running the game in the short term sense, we cannot run an event properly without an immediate donation of these items. Examples include: as per Needed, but assuming stock is extremely low, we have run out, all our supplies were lost, or similar.

## Donations of Time

---

**1 GP per - <u>Packet Creation during NPC Shift</u>**

* Time spent on packet creation during NPC Shifts is also rewarded!  For every packet crafted during a NPC shift, you will be rewarded an additional 1 Goblin Point.  For direct packet donation, see <u>Packet Donation</u> under <u>Item Donations</u>

**50 GP - <u>Event Set-Up and Clean-Up</u>**

* Event set-up and clean-up tasks include packet pick-up across the campsite, sweeping and/or mopping (if there is mud), loading or unloading NPC Camp, cleaning or organizing NPC Camp, cleaning dishes, taking trash to the dumpster, returning furniture to its rightful place, and in general, helping ensure that we return the campsite the way we found it or better.  If you provide this kind of help, be sure to let plot and/or staff know about it.

**50 GP - <u>Post Event Survey</u>**

* After each event is attended, you will have the option to subject a post-event survey to let staff and plot know about your experience so that they can use the feedback to improve the game overall or address any concerns.

**50-250 GP - <u>Plot Submissions</u>**

* Do you have an idea burning a hole into your head that you think would be a fun addition to Chronicles?  Did you spend time creating something unique and interesting that brings the world within Chronicles to life?  Great!  We love to hear about these and submissions of them, used or not, are rewarded.  This donation of time can include anything from writing mod card ideas, plotline writeups, creating in game news articles, in game artwork, and more!  Please absolutely send these in to [plot@larpchronicles.org](mailto:plot@larpchronicles.org) and be sure to ask how many Goblin Points it’s worth!

**100-600 GP - <u>NPC Shifts</u>**

* Goblin Point rewards gained for NPC Shifts differ depending on if someone is a Part Time NPC or a Full Time NPC.  For Part-Time, the option to claim Goblin Points (or a single Skill Point) is dependent on working a full shift of at least 3 hours.  Being a NPC has other rewards as well!  Be sure to read the NPCs & Benefits document for information on rewards, how often they can be claimed, and how to volunteer your time as a Part or Full Time NPC.
    * Part Time NPCs that work a full three hour shift can choose between 100 Goblin Points OR 1 additional Skill Point.  Regardless of the number of completed shifts, this may only be claimed once per event day and only if additional Skill Points are not claimed.  Assuming you have worked a full NPC shift for each event day, if an event is two days (six hours worked), you can choose to claim at most 200 GP or for three day events (nine hours worked), 300 GP at most.
    * A Full Time NPC that works the entire event is awarded 400 GP.  This does not apply to any player that PCs during the event.  For three day events, this is 600 GP.

**!?! GP - <u>Physical Representation Creation or Repair</u>**

* “Phys-rep” creation can include the creation of claw boffers, swords, shields, and/or props.  This donation of time does not require you to also provide the supplies and is rewarded as deemed by Plot and/or staff based on participation.  For already completed phys-rep donations, see Physical Representation Donation under <u>Item Donations</u>

**!?! GP - <u>Special Event Assistance</u>**

* From time to time, plot may ask one or more people for assistance in running mods outside of a NPC Shift.  This type of time donation qualifies as special event assistance and the amount of Goblin Points it rewards can vary greatly depending on the task asked of you!


## Item Donations

---
**10 GP - <u>Packet Supplies</u> (per $1)**

* Donations of packet supplies are valued at 10GP to $1 spent, rounded up.  This means if you spend $9.34 on packet supplies, it will count as $10 and you will be given 100 GP.  Do you have packets already made?  Check out <u>Packet Donation</u> below!  Packet supplies should conform to the following:
    * **Fabric **- Cut or uncut white fabric that is a biodegradable natural fiber fabric. (Cotton, abaca, bamboo, lyocell, ramie, jute, hemp, silk.)  Please do not donate nylon, fleece, acrylic, polyester, or rayon fabrics for packets.
    * **Rubber bands** - Size #32-33 is preferred (1/8"). Must be natural rubber.
    * **Birdseed **- Millet bird seed or bird seed that does **not **contain sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.

**10 GP per $1 -<u> Physical Representation Supplies</u>**

*  Supplies for phys-reps donations are rewarded with 10 Goblin Points per $1 USD value, rounded up.  This means if you spend $9.34 on phy-rep supplies, it will count as $10 and you will be given 100 GP.  Not sure what kind of supplies to donate?  Here is a short list of preferred supplies:
    * Ultralight Cores of carbon fiber, kitespar tube, fiberglass tube, or wrapped graphite tube.  Aluminum cores are only used for polearms.  Diameter should be between .414-.610”.
    * Closed Cell Foam.  This can be pipe foam insulation and pool noodles and is used to pad the “blade” of a boffer.  It should have a wall of at least 5/8” thick.
    * Open Cell Foam.  Used for boffer tips, this is a less dense foam commonly found in fabric stores as fill for pillows or in hardware stores as pipe foam.
    * Kite Tape or nylon rip stop repair tape.  Preferred vendor - [FunWithWind](https://funwithwind.com/store/ListCategoriesAndProducts2.asp?idCategory=186&idparent=171)
    * [Dap Weldwood Contact Cement](https://www.amazon.com/00271-Weldwood-Original-Contact-Cement/dp/B0006MXRY8/ref=pd_di_sccai_2?pd_rd_w=gdI93&pf_rd_p=c9443270-b914-4430-a90b-72e3e7e784e0&pf_rd_r=NXDNHRFGZV673SHKBQWS&pd_rd_r=377eca45-f83c-4a21-a00f-3b4859ff9ab9&pd_rd_wg=MvJFD&pd_rd_i=B0006MXRY8&psc=1)
    * [EVA Foam](https://www.foambymail.com/XPE2/cross-linked-polyethylene-foam-2lb.html)
    * Duct tape or strapping tape.

**10 GP per $1 - <u>Chronicles Amazon Wishlist Item(s)</u>**

* If you make a donation through the chapter’s [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/28K7OWJ8ZWO60?ref_=wl_share), make sure that plot and/or staff are aware that it is coming from you – also so that they know to watch for the package!  Anything purchased from the Wishlist is worth 10 GP per $1, rounded up.  This means if you spend $9.34 on packet supplies, it will count as $10 and you will be given 100 GP.  If an item you purchased for the Chapter from the Wishlist has a comment of “Needed” or “Critically Needed,” then you will be granted extra GP as detailed at the top of this document.

**50 GP per 25 - <u>Packet Donation (25 count)</u>**

* Each count of 25 packets rewards 50 GP.  Do note that packet material must be a biodegradable, natural fiber cloth of approx 6”x6”.  Any color is acceptable, but there is a strong preference for white fabric, because it can be easier to find with UV flashlights, making post-mod clean up much easier.  Packet contents should be seeds and must not contain sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.  Millet is highly suggested for packet contents.  For donation of time during an event to create packets with provided supplies, please see Packet Creation in <u>Donations of Time</u>

**!?! GP - <u>Physical Representation</u>**

* Completed “phys-rep” donations can include the claw boffers, swords, shields, costumes, costume jewelry, and/or props.  Donation of these items is rewarded per item and starts at 10 GP.  Higher quality donations are rewarded with more GP at the discretion of plot and/or staff.  Always confirm your reward total at the time of donation!

## Effect Clarifications


---
### Curse of Transformation
* Curse of Transformation (CoT) makes the target immune to CoT, meaning the effect does not stack.
* Any character or NPC created by CoT is not capable of inflicting CoT on another character.  The only time this is not true is for very specific and limited plot reasons.
* There are three types of CoT:  Ones that go away on death, ones that go away on resurrection, and ones that go away only with ritual.  All COTs may be removed by ritual.
  * If you are CoT into a skeleton (think like a Greater version of Create Undead), that'll probably go away on death.
  * If you are CoT into a Vampire, that might go away on Resurrection.
  * If you are CoT into a Plot device, that might require a ritual.

### Entrapment Clarification
The Entrapment spell allows a caster the chance to capture the spirit of a target.  Entrapment works on ANY creature that matches the following:
* Must have human-like intelligence.
* Must be alive.
* Must have a spirit that is **NOT** protected by a SPIRIT BOTTLE effect.
* Must not crumble at 0 hp/body.

### Metabolism Clarification
>Pending.

### Shattering & Destroying
Shattering or destroying containers that contain things does NOT affect the items within it.

### Skillless Clarification
Skilless refers to any abilities purchased with Skill Points.  You do not lose any Armor or Health Points gained from purchased skills.


## Armor Mechanics

Armor is described as extra garb pieces made of defined materials and worn in targeted locations for the purpose of providing a character with extra defense in the form of Armor Points. A character can have a number of armor up to their Armor Cap determined by what skills they have purchased. If the character is not using Fencing or Stalwart defense, they must also properly phys-rep their armor, with the type of armor required depending on the total amount of armor. Phys-repped armor grants an equivalent based on the armor type and location. Finally, in order to benefit from their armor, the character must possess the appropriate armor item tag.

## Armor and Combat

During combat, when damage is taken by a character, it is first deducted from the Armor Point total, unless otherwise stated by a specific spell or skill. If the player still has Armor Points remaining, it does not matter which location is covered by armor, they will still deduct the damage from their remaining points.

Once a character’s Armor Points are below their maximum total, they may recover them through one of three methods:  
1. The Rapid Refit martial skill, which requires 5 seconds of uninterrupted roleplay to restore a character’s Armor Point total back to its maximum.
2. Roleplay- A character may spend 1 minute of uninterrupted roleplaying adjusting armor, straps and its fit to restore a character’s armor total back to its maximum.
3. Using a Repair Kit, a crafted item by Smiths, cuts the roleplay time required to repair armor in half, to 30 seconds.

## Armor Point Calculations

A character’s Armor Points are determined by the following:  
* Their purchased Armor Cap
* Their active skills
* The type of armor worn
* The location of worn armor
* The Armor Item Tag they possess



## Armor Types

### Cloth

Thick, quilted layers designed to blunt the worst of an adversary’s blow and prevent immediately fatal strikes.  
**Required** A three-layer, quilted fabric.

| **Cloth Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 2 |
| Shoulders | 2 |
| Torso | 4 |
| Legs | 2 |
| **Max Armor Bonus** | **10** |

### Leather
Treated animal hide widely used as a cost effective means of protection, while remaining soft and supple enough to be worked similarly to fabric without loss of the wearer’s mobility.
**Required**: Suede, supple leather, faux leather, or leather appearing fabric.


| **Leather Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 4 |
| Shoulders | 4 |
| Torso | 8 |
| Legs | 4 |
| **Max Armor Bonus** | **20** |


### Hard Leather
Hardened, formed leather that retains its shape and offers significantly more protection against piercing and slashing than it’s non-hardened counterpart. Less heavy than traditional metal armor, and more cost-effective for adventurers who lack coin.
**Required**: At least 4oz hardened veg tan leather, or analog that has the ability to retain its shape under mild pressure.  

| **Hard Leather Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 6 |
| Shoulders | 6 |
| Torso | 12 |
| Legs | 6 |
| **Max Armor Bonus** | **30** |






### Chain/Composite
Concentric, interlocking metal rings that provide a lighter alternative to full platemail armor, and allows for greater flexibility at the cost of sacrificing protection from piercing and crushing weapon blows.

**Required**: Chainmail, rigid interlocked or overlapping rings/plates, fabric with simulated/printed chainmail pattern.

| **Chain Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 8 |
| Shoulders | 8 |
| Torso | 16 |
| Legs | 8 |
| **Max Armor Bonus** | **40** |


### Plate
Heavy, durable metal armor that provides superior protection from all manner of enemy attacks.
**Required:** Solid formed metal plates, foam, plastic or other material that maintains its shape with firm pressure, preferably with an outward metallic appearance.

| **Plate Coverage** | **Armor Points** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arms | 16 |
| Shoulders | 16 |
| Torso | 32 |
| Legs | 16 |
| **Max Armor Bonus** | **80** |	



## Armor Locations

While a player may wear armor wherever and however they choose as is thematically appropriate for their character, there are only 4 locations that will count toward a character’s final Armor Point total:

* Arms- Left and Right
* Shoulders- Left and Right
* Legs- Left and Right
* Torso - Front and Back

If a character only wears half of a paired location (arms, shoulders, legs), they will only get half the given value for that armor. \
Ex: Verse wears a plate pauldron on only his left shoulder, leaving his right shoulder uncovered. This means it would count as 8 armor instead of the full 16. If he happened to wear a chainshirt that covered his other shoulder, that would give him another 4 points of armor (half of Chainmail 8 for shoulder location.) For a total of 12 Armor from his two shoulders.



### ARMOR LOCATION REFERENCE
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">For example:</span> Spurt the Kobold has purchased enough Armor Training to raise their total Armor Cap to 30 points.



* They have not purchased any ranks in Fencing or Stalwart Defense, and so they must wear a phys rep of all their armor.
* Spurt is wearing a chain shirt (16 points), hard leather greaves (6 points), hard leather pauldrons (6 points), and cloth bracers (2 points).
* Spurt possesses an Armor Tag for 30 points of Armor.

Altogether, Spurt is wearing a total of 30 Armor Points, and has an Armor Cap of 30, which means they are able to use all of their Armor Points during combat.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Another example:</span> Villi the Forged has purchased enough Armor Training to raise their Armor Cap to 45 points.



* They have purchased 2 ranks of Stalwart Defense, which allows them to have another 10 Armor Points without an armor phys rep.
* They are wearing a plate torso piece (36 points), hard leather bracers (6 points) and hard leather greaves on their legs (6 points).
* Villi possesses an Armor Tag for 45 points of Armor.

Villi is wearing a total of 48 Armor Points, plus their ranks in Stalwart Defense which brings their total to 58. Because this is over their Armor Cap, they will only be able to use 55 Armor Points.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Final Example: </span>Raphael the Elf has purchased enough Armor Training to raise their Armor Cap to 20 points.



* They have purchased 4 ranks of Fencing, which allows them to have another 20 Armor Points without an armor phys rep.
* They are wearing a chain torso piece (16 points) and leather bracers (4 points).
* Raphael currently does not possess an armor tag.

Raphael is wearing a total of 40 points of armor, 20 from phys reps and 20 from Fencing, however, because they do not possess an item tag for their armor, they may not benefit from any phys-repped armor. As such, their current armor total is 20 from Fencing. If Raphael gets an Armor Tag worth at least 20 points, they will be able to benefit from their full armor.

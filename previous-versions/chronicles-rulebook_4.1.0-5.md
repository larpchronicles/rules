Oh hi, welcome to Chronicles!  We hope you are ready to make friends that you will not soon be rid of.  Before getting too far into this rulebook, take a deep breath.  This rulebook is long, packed full of information, and there is a lot to absorb.  It can be overwhelming all at once.  Take it in sections and ask all the questions!  PS - Don't forget to exhale.

# New Player Guide

---

## Hello (potentially) New Player!

Welcome to Chronicles.  Whether you have been LARPing for years or have never seen a tabard in your life, Chronicles welcomes you.  Chronicles is your story waiting to happen.  You share the story with many other players, but you are no less important!  Our community aims to foster a safe place for players to act out these stories and share in the experiences of being the hero (or villain) of their own story, be them triumphs or losses.

We would love for you to get involved at a speed you are comfortable with. Many ways to do this are possible:
* Attending and hanging out before a game to meet people and ask questions.
* Try playing a Non-Player Character (NPC) for a weekend and experience different aspects of the game.  Volunteering as a NPC can be a great opportunity to get a broader grasp of the rules, try different abilities, and experience alternate combat styles, all while you have someone from staff available to help guide you, answer questions, and ensure you are also having a good time.
* Play a pre-built character. 
* Dive in and make a character of your own.

We hope you reach out soon, make a character, and become a familiar face to the market fair of Varos.

## Getting Started
Ready to create your first character, but do not know where to start?  This section is full of references, tips, advice from new and old players, and information aimed at helping with fleshing out a character concept.

Note:  While reading this rulebook, please remember that when this rulebook refers to "players", it is referring to the real-life person playing the game.  When it refers to "characters" it may refer to characters of players or non-monster characters played by staff or volunteers. "Player characters" (PCs) refers only to the characters of players.

### Character Creation

Creating a first character can be daunting, especially if a player has not roleplayed before.  Relax!  There is no requirement to show up with a fully fleshed out character on a first event -- or event a second, but you will want to have an idea of who your character is before their first market fair.  After all, adventurers are not born full-sized and equipped.  

The following questions not required to be answered.  They are intended to help you understand your character, so you can better portray them to fellow players and staff.

#### Character Considerations:
* What did your character do to make a living? 
* Where did your character live? 
* How does (or did) your character live? (Quality, professions, etc)
* Where did your character learn to use weapons/magic? 
* Who were/are your character's parents? 
* Does your character have siblings?
* Who likes your character?  Who does not like them?
* Does your character have any special rules, morals, ethics, or beliefs they adhere to?
* Does your character have goals or personal quests? 
* When did the adventuring life take hold? 
* Does your character have any outstanding debts? 
* Did your character have preconceived notions of other adventurers? 
* Who or what is important to your character?

#### Mechanically Building a Character:
All new players start with 100 Skill Points (SP), 10 body, and 5 armor.  <i>Body is the term used for a character's health or hit points.</i>  The 5 armor is considered a free bonus as long as the player is wearing garb or a costume.  Skill Points are used to purchase skills like the ability to swing a sword or cast a spell.  Players can use the Character Calculator to design their character.

1. Pick a name: People are going to have to call your character something!
2. Pick a Race: Your character's heritage dictates some extra abilities and can be a key element to the presentation of your character.
3. Choose Specializations: There are several pools that are used in Chronicles. Prioritization of those specializations determines the cost of the abilities inside of that pool.  Even if a player does not intend to be involved in combat, it may behoove them in the future to have these picked out.
   - Loosely you can look at them this way:
     - Stamina focuses on buying weapon proficiencies and skills to do damage. 
     - Agility focuses on buying utility skills that influence combat through means other than damage.
     - Magic focuses on buying the schools of magic, and mana to use the spells in those schools.
4. Purchase applicable skills using skill points:  This is how to fine-tune a character and the feats they are capable of.  We also have a calculator to help make this easier!

### Skill Point Gain:
* All characters earn 3 Skill Points per day of an event.
* Characters under 200 Build gain Skill Points at 2x the rate.
* Players can accrue up to 1 extra Skill Point per day by working a NPC shift (See the sections on NPC and Goblin Points for more details).

### Reallocating Skill Points
* All characters under 200 Skill Points can be recreated or rewritten between events, including the character's name, race, skillset selection, SP expenditures, and transforms.
* Above 200 Skill Points, players may freely reallocate their skillset selections and Skill Point allocations between events. Changing the character's race and other aspects of the character require approval from the Plot Team.
* During an event, characters may only reallocate their Skill Points as the result of a Spirit Forge ritual, when unlocking new transform abilities, or with the approval of the Head of Plot.  
    * _Note: A player cannot reallocate any Skill Points that had been invested in Gathering and Production skills that were used to gather resources or produce items previously in the same event (including at check-in), and the character will not be able to gather resources or produces items as a result of reallocating Skill Points into those skills in the same event._  
* <i>A Spirit Forge is an advanced ritual that allows a player to change their character's class and skill point purchases.</i>

### Quick Reference of Common Terms
If they have not before reaching this section, new players are sure to hear plenty of words or acronyms used that they may be unclear on as to the meaning -- or at least the meaning of them for Chronicles.  Below is a short list of those someone will likely hear.  A longer glossary is available further in the rulebook.

|Term|Meaning|Explanation|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Body|Numerical value representative of a character's health.|Also sometimes referred to as health or hit points.|
|Boffer|A weapon physical representation.|Also referred to as "claws" or "bites" depending on length.  These are simple weapon reps.|
|Build|The total amount of Skill Points a player has.|This term is often used interchangeably with Skill Points or SP and not a way to refer to SP while roleplaying.|
|Concentration|An action taken for in game benefit.|Concentration is used for many things, such as abilities or Resting (see below).  While Concentrating, a player must be silent, may not use skills or items, and may not run.|
|GP|Goblin Points|The name of points given to players in exchange for volunteering or donating their time and/or money.|
|IBGA|In Between Game Actions|This is a heads up email sent to plot at least a week prior to the next event that gives them an idea of what a player's character worked on "off board".  It is a good option for things that do not need back and forth such as research, sending a letter, or a boring thing a player does not want to do at game. |
|IC/IG|In Character/In Game|Refers to things that are happening in the game.|
|Metagaming|Players choosing to use out of character knowledge as their characters.|This is when a character knows things they did not actually learn in game and either communicates it to others or modifies their behavior against their normal behavior or in response to the OOC knowledge.|
|Mod|Module|This is an event during game where plot will run pieces of storyline for players to interact with.|
|NPC|Non-Player Character|This is either plot or a player volunteering time and is either going to be a character or a mob.|
|OOG/OOC|Out of Game/ Out of Character.|Separating a player's knowledge from their character's knowledge is a hard practiced skill.  Most players actively avoid engaging in metagaming, but there are good forms of metagaming, such as ensuring others get involved.|
|PC|Player Character|This may sometimes be used to refer to the players, but in general it refers the character a player is portraying.|
|Phys Rep/Rep|Physical representation|Also referred to as "rep".  Term for any weapon, shield, armor, or item prop.|
|Rest|Skill/Ability Reset|Rest or resting referrs to when a player is able to reset their used skills and/or abilities.|
|Retcon|Revising words or actions.|Retconning is announced on an out of game level and refers to when a player wishes to "take back" character's actions or words.  Most often, this is done because of an out of game misunderstanding.|
|RP|Roleplay|Roleplay refers to actions, emotes, or words that are considered to be performed not by the player, but by a character.|
|SP|Skill Points|Points that accrue over a number of events a player attend that can be used to purchase or improve skills.|


## How Does Combat Work?
Chronicles is a boffer combat LARP that focuses as much on roleplay and interaction between PCs and NPCs as physical combat.  The goal of combat is for all participants and observers to be safe.  We emphasize light combat.  A general rule is, if a player's swing is enough to hurt someone, they are probably swinging too hard.  While accidents may happen, someone is more likely to twist an ankle on uneven ground than hurt themselves during combat.  More details can be found in the Combat section of the rulebook.


### How To Regain Expended Skills and Abilities
Skills and abilities are renewed through what is called rest, where a character spends ten minutes Concentrating.  Concentration requires the character to be silent, not use skills, abilities, or items, and not move faster than a walk.

Some skills or abilities are listed as "Daily".  These skills and abilities are renewed between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.  If a player is on a module (an event during game run by plot) between that time frame, they must attempt the reset immediately after it ends.  Daily skills and abilities require ten minutes of concentration to refresh.  More information about rest can be found in the Resting section.


### What To Bring To a First Event
Chronicles often has spare equipment to loan to newer players. That being said, beyond LARP-specific items, there are several things that any player should bring:
* Plain Clothes
* Comfortable Footwear
* Water Bottle/Canteen
* Notebook and Writing Utensil
* Hand Fan, Sunscreen, Bug spray
* Light

**Plain Clothes**
If a player is new and does not have lots of fancy LARP clothing yet, they do not need to worry!  A solid colored shirt and pants work just fine as starter clothes. Cargo pants (or similar) are great for early events due to the extra pockets. For shirts, a simple t-shirt, button up, or sweatshirt work fine. The most important part is that any clothing used does not have large graphics or logos on them.

**Comfortable Footwear**
Chronicles generally involves at least a moderate amount of walking. Therefor, comfortable footwear and socks are highly important. It is always recommended to make sure footwear is comfortable rather than just stylish. Extra socks are just as important. Especially if it is damp or rain is predicted.

**Water Bottle**
Especially important when it is hot out, but always useful. Chronicles generally has drinks, including water, on site, but sometimes a player finds themselves far away from the places they are stored. Having a portable source of liquid is incredibly useful for long mods.

**Notebook and Writing Utensil**
Notes are incredibly useful, both for in and out of game information. Many places sell notepads small enough to fit in a pocket. That plus some pens or pencils is a very cheap way to keep track of information.

**Hand Fan, Sunscreen, Bug Spray**
Chronicles is primarily an outdoors event. That means heat, sun, insects, water, and everything else. Simple things that are taken on any outdoor trip, like a fan, sunscreen, and bug spray, can help make an event significantly more enjoyable.

Allergic to DDT or prefer something more natural?  Be sure to test for allergic reactions before utilizing:  An effective repellent can be made by diluting rosemary essential oil with water.  About 10 drops per 1-2oz of water in a spray bottle.

**Light**
This one is more personal preference. Some people prefer to bring a light source to events. In most cases, this is a low-lumen flashlight or LED lantern. In all cases, the light needs to be dim enough to not blind other players. Usually this is done by covering the light in layers of cloth, commonly held on with rubber bands or hair ties, to dim it down.  Red lights and stargazing flashlights also work, although some may still need dimming.  If a brighter light is needed or about to be in use, it is generally polite to warn other players before turning it on, so they are prepared.

## What to Expect at an Event
Chronicles is a fantasy LARP. This means lots of swords, sorcery, and exotic races.  Game takes place from Friday evening through Sunday morning for a two-day event and Friday evening through Monday morning for a three-day event.

### Typical progression for a two-day event:
* **Friday**: Game begins on Friday evening. Site opens around 5 pm. Players check in with staff, find their beds, and get into costume. Check in may last until 10-11pm. Following check in, PC Talk is held, typically in a building identified as the tavern.  PC Talk is where plot & staff review important information for the event.  PC Talk completes with a communicated Lay On time.  Lay On is when the game officially starts.
* **Saturday**: Most of the gaming takes place on Saturday, and people can usually find something to do.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served on Saturday too. Any players with dietary restrictions or allergies should alert staff during pre-registration or check in.
* **Sunday**: Gaming typically goes into early Sunday morning and usually wraps up between 2-4am.  Sunday is also when people pack up, complete checkout, clean up the site, and depart. Generally, people try to have everything done by noon.

### Important Locations
The exact physical locations of these vary by campsite, although they are usually pointed out during PC Talk.
* **Cabins (In Game)**: Where players sleep and store in game and out of game items not currently in use. If possible, out of game items are best stored under the beds or in a marked container to avoid confusion.
* **Tavern (In Game)**: The main in-game building. This is where most people gather between activities/mods and where both friendly and hostile Non-Player Characters (NPCs) tend to gather. It is also where meals are served and where snacks and drinks can be bought.
* **NPC Camp/Logistics (Out Of Game)**: NPC Camp or Logistics is where the plot team is located when they are not out running mods or playing NPCs. The building is considered out of game (OOG), although it may occasionally be used to run non-combat mods. It also usually has a whiteboard that players may add their name and a small note to in order to request a mod.  This allows the plot team to know what specific activities to run.  As this is a building used by plot and staff and there may be on-going discussions concerning a storyline, please make sure to knock before entering.
* **Plot Cabin (Out Of Game)**: Where plot, full time NPCs (volunteers that assist plot for the full event), and sometimes staff sleep and store their personal belongings.  This building is considered OOG.  Like NPC Camp, it may occasionally be used to run non-combat mods.

### General Advice
Do not be afraid to ask questions.  Even in the middle of combat or intense role playing, do not be afraid to ask what something does or means.  There are also many people with a decent grasp on the rules who can answer questions.  In game, asking questions is just as useful, although it may not always yield answers.

Remember, it is a game. We are all here to have fun and in general, people do not want to be rude or mean to others.  Try not to let any in-game interactions affect personal OOG opinions of the person behind the character.  In roleplay, many people act in ways they never would in real life!  That is one of the joys of the event.  It is not personal.  They do not hate the player, just the character.

However, sometimes, a player may find themselves with the perception that something negative occurred due to an OOG reason, may feel themselves becoming frustrated, or experienced something that they find disruptively upsetting.  In these situations and all like it, please never hesitate to approach staff about it or go out of game for a while.

## Secondary Characters
Once a player hits 200 Skill Points, they may create a secondary character.  This character will always have 75 percent of the primary character's SP, rounded up to the nearest whole number.  All characters beyond the second character will have 50 percent of the primary character's SP, rounded up to the nearest whole number.  No matter what character is played, all gained SP will be applied to the primary character.  Aside from SP, everything is tracked separately for each character (SP Debt, ritual effects, items, etc).

Example:
> Jim has 275 SP.  His primary character has 275 SP. His secondary character has 206 SP.  His third/fourth/fifth/etc character has 137 SP.
> Jim attends a 2 day event and gains 6 SP.  His primary character now has 281 SP.  His secondary character has 75% of this, and now has 210 SP.  His third/fourth/fifth/etc character has 140 SP.

If a player wants to promote a character to their primary character and demote their primary to that character's position, they may do so with Plot's approval.
# Game Setting

---
Chronicles is a sword & sorcery fantasy game set in a pre-industrial world called Evren.  Our chapter primarily centers around the port town of Varos within the Kingdom of the Terran Valley.  Adventurers from all over this world meet in Varos for the market fairs.

In Evren, adventurers may be regarded as <i>different</i> from the normal folk in the world.  

A weekend event is referred to as a market fair and these are nearly always held in Varos, but Evren has plenty of other locations to visit, ~explode~ explore, form alliances, build towns, make enemies, and more.  A longer, player-maintained glossary of in world places and people can be found in the glossary of the rulebook.

## Game Atmosphere
Chronicles science, medicine, and technology is roughly equivalent to 14th century Earth.  For roleplay, players are encouraged to act, speak, and behave as if they exist in that time frame.  We do of course allow players to use modern medicine but if possible, it should be done away from a large crowd to promote the in game atmosphere.

### Religion
There are beings known as gods in Chronicles, but how a character views or engages with them is up to the individual player.  No character is required to worship a god.

We strive to be inclusive and respectful at Chronicles and do not want anyone to be in the situation of giving offense to others.  The use of any real world religious symbols or iconography in the game, including costuming, garb, or props, is explicitly disallowed.  Similarly, in roleplay, it is unacceptable to use invocations of gods, demons, mythical creatures, legends, or other recognizable figures of real world religious, spiritual, or mythological importance.

### Politics
In game politics are part of life. Whether a character wishes to serve the king loyally, ignore his command, or attempt a rebellion is up to them!  Just know that there may be in-game consequences for a character's actions.  OOG political symbols, slogans, and iconography are explicitly disallowed.

### Necromancy
Evren as a whole does not view necromancy as an inherently evil or bad thing, though most people find it at least distasteful. There are laws against it in nearly all kingdoms, and for those where it isn't, there are guilds that regulate and oversee its use.
# Who You Will Encounter:  Staff, Players, Trust

## Plot Members and Marshals
Plot members and marshals are part of the staff of Chronicles.  The plot team serves the same function as a game master does in a tabletop role playing game (RPG).  During an event, the plot team works from the building identified as NPC Camp or Logistics. They will give rulings, run a mod, observe a ritual, and other out of game (OOG) tasks that are needed throughout a market fair.  If a player has a question on a rule or how something works, they will need to ask the appropriate marshal.  

**Plot Member**
A member of the group of people who work together to keep the game moving, adjudicate rules, run mods, and many other roles essential to the game.  In tabletop terms, they are essentially the game master or dungeon master.

**Mod Marshal**
A person who runs a mod for a group for PCs.  They will set the stage giving descriptions, locations, etc. Should any rule questions or disputes come up, the marshal has final say.  If a player believes the marshal made an incorrect call, they may bring it up with the marshal or a member of plot after the mod, when it does not disrupt the flow of the game.

**Ritual Marshal**
A person who oversees a player character (PC) perform ritual magic.  They will ensure all factors of the ritual are performed by the PCs and determine if the ritual is a success or failure.  More complex rituals will require a full plot member.

**Rogue Marshal**
If a character wishes to steal from someone's cabin, the player must have a rogue marshal present.  This marshal ensures that personal property is not taken, and that the would-be thief follows all rules of the game (lockpicking chests, recognizing circles of power, etc.)  Entering a cabin with intent to steal without a rogue marshal can have severe consequences such as referring the person to the local police for theft or breaking and entering.

### How to Become A Ritual Marshal
To become a ritual marshal, a player will need to volunteer with the head of the plot team.  The head of plot will ensure that the player knows the ritual rules and have the player marshal some rituals with a plot member.  Once the player has proven themselves, they can become a ritual marshal.


## Expectations of Participants

### General Etiquette
Help ensure we can return to these sites for future events by being respectful of the facilities and cleaning up after yourself.  If you notice a problem anywhere in the facility, please alert a member of the Plot Team or Staff immediately.

Pick up packets at the end of each fight or mod.  If they are wet, torn, or damaged, please throw them away.  Do NOT return these to the packet bucket, as this encourages the growth of mold.

You are responsible for cleaning your cabin at the end of the event.  This includes removal of personal items, trash removal, turning off lights, fans, the AC/Heat unit, and if necessary, sweeping and mopping.  For cabins with bathrooms and kitchens, this includes cleaning of these areas.

Smoking in the cabins is prohibited.  You must field strip your cigarettes.  If you do not know what this is, read here: https://www.wikihow.com/Field-Strip-a-Cigarette Please do not leave cigarette butts on the ground.

Do not bash specific groups or people.  It is okay to complain about circumstances and events without being specific.


### Hold & Medic Calls

If you hear anyone call "Hold" or "Medic" you must immediately stop all activity, movement, and be silent unless directed otherwise.  If you are physically able to, drop to one knee.  **These calls indicate an Out of Game emergency.**

Only the persons who have been identified as a Medic by the Plot Team or Staff should respond to the call of "Medic."  A Medic is an individual with CPR and/or First Aid certification or has a license to practice medicine.

Please do not call "Hold" or "Medic" unless you or someone else is injured in real life.


### In Game vs. Out of Game Areas & Combat

Out of Game Areas are areas that you are not permitted to engage in combat in.  You may not chase PCs or NPCs into these areas nor use these areas to hide from In Game events, NPCs, etc.

Bathrooms, showers, and Logistics/NPC Camp are considered Out of Game Areas.

#### No-Combat Areas
> Camp Eastman: The kitchen, stairwell, and second floor of the Lodge are considered in game, but combat is disallowed.
>
> All Sites: The kitchen in the dining hall (tavern) is also considered in game and combat is disallowed in this area.

Unless otherwise noted by staff, all other areas are considered in game.

# Storytelling & Goals

## Adventures (Formerly Mods)
If adventurers are leaving town to do anything they are heading out for a mod (named after the tabletop pre-designed "modules"). Mods are how staff/plot (the people) drive a plot (the narrative) when a character decides on a course of action.  On occasion, the mod will come to the players, and NPCs will arrive at the market fair looking for a fight or maybe even someone to go do something for them. Mods do not always mean fighting, but there is a reason some of Evren's cities are encircled with walls. The goal of a mod is to make the story move a little.

## Town Encounters (Formerly Town Mods)
While a character may have or make personal stories with interactions with other characters and NPCs, sometimes things are larger than a single character. Happenings that absorb the effort of everyone at the market fair are adventures. Whether that's the whole town being transported to another dimension and finding a way out, or the local Orc tribes have started sieging Varos. These are opportunities to work together and drive a story forward someone otherwise may have never touched. The goal of adventures is teamwork and creating character interactions.

## Storyline
Any collection of mods and adventures adds up to a plot line, storyline, or plot (narrative).  Plot lines at Chronicles often interlace and are generally involved with adventures & mods. Plot lines hopefully culminate with a narrative payoff. For some players, that might be completing a transform prerequisite, magic items, narrative satisfaction as they banish a metaphorical ghost of their character's past, or winning the trust of fellow adventurers. The goal of a plot line is to put characters on the stage and see how they react to particular situations.  At any time, if a player finds they did not enjoy something on a storyline or mod, they are encouraged to tell staff/plot.  We want all of our players to have fun and will strive to correct bad experiences when we are made aware of them.

## Goals (capital G)
The goal of telling stories of any size and medium is the entertainment of its audience. Staff/plot is not a separate team in opposition to players. Staff/plot is trying to create an enjoyable experience for all players and have some fun for themselves. LARP is a collaborative experience, and if a player is not having fun or did not like how something happened, they are strongly encouraged to vocalize it to staff/plot so that we can work together to resolve it.

# Equipment 

## Weapon Construction
All weapons must have at least 5/8" of closed cell foam (ie, pipe foam, crosslinked EVA foam, etc.) completely covering the striking surface.

Thrusting tips must be at least 2" of open cell foam, and the core of the weapon must not be able to be felt through the thrusting tip. Weapons that do not have an open cell foam thrusting cannot be used to thrust or jab!

All weapons must have a closed cell foam pommel that completely envelopes the pommel end of the weapon core. This can be pipe foam, EVA foam, a foam fishing butt cap, or similar.

## Weapon Crafting Materials
* Ultralight Cores of carbon fiber, kitespar tube, fiberglass tube, or wrapped graphite tube.  Aluminum cores may only be used for polearms.  Diameter should be between .414-.610".
* Closed Cell Foam.  This can be pipe foam insulation and pool noodles and is used to pad the "blade" of a boffer.  It should have a wall at least 5/8" thick.
* Open Cell Foam.  Used for boffer tips, this is a less dense foam commonly found in fabric stores as fill for pillows or in hardware stores as pipe foam.
* Kite Tape or nylon rip stop repair tape.  Preferred vendor - [FunWithWind](https://funwithwind.com/store/ListCategoriesAndProducts2.asp?idCategory=186&idparent=171)
* [Dap Weldwood Contact Cement](https://www.amazon.com/00271-Weldwood-Original-Contact-Cement/dp/B0006MXRY8/ref=pd_di_sccai_2?pd_rd_w=gdI93&pf_rd_p=c9443270-b914-4430-a90b-72e3e7e784e0&pf_rd_r=NXDNHRFGZV673SHKBQWS&pd_rd_r=377eca45-f83c-4a21-a00f-3b4859ff9ab9&pd_rd_wg=MvJFD&pd_rd_i=B0006MXRY8&psc=1)
* [EVA Foam](https://www.foambymail.com/XPE2/cross-linked-polyethylene-foam-2lb.html)
* Duct tape or strapping tape.

## Weapon Crafters
We have some players that make weapons that will sometimes coordinate with others to custom make something.  Asking in [Discord](http://larpchronicles.com/discord) is a good place to start if you would like to go this route.

A few online storefronts will have ready-made things, but please do ask others here about these places because some vendors have material and design types you will want to avoid if you want to pass weapons safety checks for most LARPs.





# Garb
Continued participation in Chronicles will require a costume for a character that draws on fantasy and historical influences. A costume helps with being a part of the world, allows for the expression of aspects of a character, and contributes towards the effort to create an experience that feels like an otherworldly adventure. Wearing garb saves mundane clothes from getting damaged or dirty and can serve as an additional indicator for whether the player's character is present or the player is NPCing.

While garb need not be constructed with historical techniques and materials -- nobody is going to throw a fit over polyester blends -- efforts should be taken to escape the modern "jeans & t-shirt" silhouette. Fellow players can help create or find suitable elements.  Costuming is sort of a journey all players are consistently on.

Beyond that, jewelry and pouches are just a few other accessories that create endless opportunities for character expression. While adding to garb/costume, players need to make certain that they do not have anything that endangers them or others.  e.g. Glass vials are neat, but when they break they become hazards that must be properly disposed of.  Dangling hoop earrings may suit a character, but they could be snagged by a weapon and pulled.

A Note on Disguises:  PCs will always recognize PCs despite disguises.

# NPC-Garb
Those who are NPCing often wear tabards that allude to what they are playing. It may be hard to tell what is going on in the dark. A player can always wear their headband and ask, "Are you there?/ Are you in game?" or as their character, ask, "Who goes there?"	If an answer is given without full information, the PC has the option to move & inspect them closer at their own peril and asking, "What do I see?"
# Melee Weapons


---
* All combat reps must be certified as safe. Safety checks for all combat reps may be performed at check-in.  Safety checks MUST be performed EVERY EVENT; they do not carry over from prior events.  A marshal may request to inspect your reps at any time during the event, and, if deemed unsafe, may lose their safety certification.
* Claws / Bites must be made to normal weapon specs, including approved core materials and must have more than a 4" striking surface.


| WEAPON               | STRIKING SURFACE | HANDLE LENGTH | TOTAL LENGTH | HEAD REQUIRED |
|:---------------------|:----------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| Short Sword / Claws  |    18" - 24"     |   5" - 14"    |   24" - 36"  |      No       |
| * Short Blunt / Axe  |    18" - 24"     |   5" - 14"    |   24" - 36"  |      Yes      |
| Long Sword / Bites   |    18" - 36"     |   5" - 14"    |  >36" - 48"  |      No       |
| * Long Blunt / Axe   |    18" - 36"     |   5" - 14"    |  >36" - 48"  |      Yes      |
| Two-Handed Sword     |    40" - 48"     |   5" - 30"    |  >48" - 60"  |      No       |
| Two-Handed Blunt     |    40" - 48"     |   5" - 30"    |  >48" - 60"  |      Yes      |
| ** Spear (One-Handed)|    30" - 45"     |   5" - 30"    |   48" - 60"  |      No       |
| * Polearm            |    40" - 48"     |   5" - 30"    |   60" - 72"  |      Yes      |
| Parrying Dagger      |    7"  - 13"     |   5" - 6"     |   12" - 18"  |      No       |

&#42; You can only swing (Cannot stab) with a Polearm or a blunt weapon.
<BR>
** You can only stab (cannot swing) with a spear.

### Striking Surface ### 
The striking surface specifies the minimum and maximum amount of padded striking surface the weapon *must* have. _Any weapon that has less padding than the specified minimums will not pass inspection, even if it falls within the Total Length requirements!_

### Handle Length ###
The handle length specifies the minimum and maximum length of the handle by which the weapon can be wielded or held.

`Example: A Short Sword with a 14" handle will have to be at least 32" long overall, to accommodate the minimum striking surface length of 18" (14" handle + 18" striking surface = 32" total length). It is not possible to make a 24" long Short Sword that has a 14" handle; the blade would be only 10" long, which is less than the minimum (18") for the striking surface of a short sword.`

### Weapon Heads ###
Axes, blunt weapons, and polearms are required to have an open cell foam "head" that clearly conveys what the weapon represents. The minimum size of a weapon head is 4"x2"x2".

# Ranged Weapons

* Real archery reps are disallowed.  Packet Bows are allowed on a case-by-case basis.

### Bows
A Bow must be curved and formed in the shape of a bow. Overall length in a straight line from tip to tip must be between 34 and 58 inches and the curve of the bow can be a maximum of 12 inches.  A bow must pass all standard safety checks.


### Crossbows
The stock must be at least 12" long, and each limb must extend at least 6" from the stock (making the whole thing at least 12" wide).  The maximum dimensions of a crossbow can be 24" x 24".

If you wrap a string around the perimeter of the rep, the area it encloses must be at least 72 sq. in. (A 12" base, 12" height isosceles triangle).

If attached to your arm, you cannot use the bow while holding anything else in that hand, you cannot use the crossbow to block attacks, and you cannot attack with any melee weapons in either hand. If you want to be able to block with a shield, a weapon, or attack with a weapon, you must first remove the crossbow from your arm (or securely fold the limbs to the stock). If you are struck by any weapon, even if it does not strike the bow, you must spend at least 3 seconds roleplaying restringing the bow before you may fire it again.

The rep will be subject to a more rigorous safety inspection than a typical melee rep. It is **strongly** advised that you run your design idea past the staff before you begin construction; we would hate to see someone put a lot of time, effort, and resources into something that won't meet safety expectations.

# Shields

---
## Shield Construction
* A shield cannot be longer than 36" in any dimension (including diagonally), shorter than 12" in any direction, and must encompass an area less than 720 sq.in.
* Everything that is part of the shield counts as the shield.
* The surface area of the shield is calculated as if the shield were a flattened surface, and counts concavities in the shield's silhouette.
  * If the shield is curved or the face of the shield has three dimensions (ex: A partial cylinder, a dome shield, etc.), then the area is calculated including that space.
  * If you cover the face of your shield with tape, then the area of the shield would be (at minimum) equal to the area of tape.
  * If you took a string and wrapped it around the shield edge, the shape enclosed by that string is (at minimum) the area of the shield.


## Shield Crafting Materials
* Closed Cell Foam.  This can be pipe foam insulation and pool noodles and is sometimes used to pad edges.
* [Dap Weldwood Contact Cement](https://www.amazon.com/00271-Weldwood-Original-Contact-Cement/dp/B0006MXRY8/ref=pd_di_sccai_2?pd_rd_w=gdI93&pf_rd_p=c9443270-b914-4430-a90b-72e3e7e784e0&pf_rd_r=NXDNHRFGZV673SHKBQWS&pd_rd_r=377eca45-f83c-4a21-a00f-3b4859ff9ab9&pd_rd_wg=MvJFD&pd_rd_i=B0006MXRY8&psc=1)
* [EVA Foam](https://www.foambymail.com/XPE2/cross-linked-polyethylene-foam-2lb.html)
* Duct tape or strapping tape.
* Scrub brush handles.  The plastic handles on kitchen scrub brushes are often used as shield handles.
* Belts or webbing. Shield handles and straps are often created with belts and or webbing.
# Armor

---
Armor is described as extra garb pieces made of defined materials and worn in targeted locations for the purpose of providing a character with extra defense in the form of Armor Points. A character can have a number of Armor Points up to their Armor Cap determined by what skills they have purchased. If the character is not using Dexterity Armor, they must also properly phys-rep their armor, with the type of armor required depending on the total amount of Armor Points. Phys-repped armor grants an equivalent based on the armor type and location. Finally, in order to benefit from Phys-repped armor, the character must possess the appropriate armor item tag. A player can only benefit from one armor item tag at a time.

## Armor Repair / Refit Armor

During combat, when damage is taken by a character, it is first deducted from the Armor Point total, unless otherwise stated by a specific spell or skill. If the player still has Armor Points remaining, it does not matter which location is covered by armor, they will still deduct the damage from their remaining points.

Once a character's Armor Points are below their maximum total, they may recover them through one of two methods:
1. The Rapid Refit Stamina Ability, which requires 5 seconds of uninterrupted roleplay to restore a character's Armor Point total back to its maximum.
2. Standard refitting of armor is achieved through roleplay. - A character may spend 1 minute of uninterrupted roleplaying adjusting armor, straps, and fit to restore a character's armor total back to its maximum.  A character may not walk during this.

## Armor Point Calculations

A character's Armor Points are determined by the following:
* Their purchased Armor Cap
* Their active skills
* The type of armor worn
* The location of worn armor
* The Armor Item Tag they possess

## Armor Types

There are 3 armor types: Light, Medium, and Heavy. An armor rep will be assigned a type when it is evaluated by a marshal. The type assigned to a rep will be determined by the material's rigidity, strength, and ability to resist punctures.

**Light Armor**: Flexible materials that are easily pierced, such as cloth or leather.  
**Medium Armor**: Materials that can resist mild pressure, but could still be pierced by eg. a foil or a crossbow bolt. Chainmail, hardened leather.  
**Heavy Armor**: Rigid materials that resist flexing and are resistant to being pierced, eg. platemail, scalemail.

| **Armor Type** | **Arm Armor Points** | **Leg Armor Points** | **Torso Armor Points** | **Max Armor Points** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Light Armor | 5 | 5 | 10 | 20 |
| Medium Armor | 10 | 10 | 20 | 40 |
| Heavy Armor | 20 | 20 | 40 | 80 |


### Light Armor

#### Cloth
Thick, quilted layers designed to blunt the worst of an adversary's blow and prevent immediately fatal strikes.  
**Required** A three-layer, quilted fabric, suede, supple leather, faux leather, or leather appearing fabric.

### Medium Armor
#### Hardened Leather
Hardened, formed leather that retains its shape and offers significantly more protection against piercing and slashing than its non-hardened counterpart. Less heavy than traditional metal armor, and more cost-effective for adventurers who lack coin.  
**Required**: At least 4oz hardened veg tan leather, or analog that has the ability to retain its shape under mild pressure.

#### Chain/Composite
Concentric, interlocking metal rings that provide a lighter alternative to full platemail armor, and allows for greater flexibility at the cost of sacrificing protection from piercing and crushing weapon blows.  
**Required**: Chainmail, rigid interlocked or overlapping rings/plates, fabric with simulated/printed chainmail pattern.

### Heavy Armor
#### Plate
Heavy, durable metal armor that provides superior protection from all manner of enemy attacks.  
**Required:** Solid formed metal plates, foam, plastic or other material that maintains its shape with firm pressure, preferably with an outward metallic appearance.

## Armor Locations

While a player may wear armor wherever and however they choose as is thematically appropriate for their character, there are only 3 locations that will count toward a character's final Armor Point total: **Arms**, **Legs**, and **Torso**.

Each location has "zones" of coverage. For an armor rep to contribute to a character's armor total, it must cover at least half of the zones for its location.

| **Armor Type** | **Zones** |
| --- | --- |
| Arms | Forearms, Upper Arms, Shoulders |
| Legs | Shins, Calves, Thighs |
| Torso | Front, Back |

### Helmets

A helmet can be substituted for either leg or arm armor. A character that is already wearing arm armor and leg armor will receive no benefit from wearing a helmet.

To qualify, helmets must be at least semi-rigid and otherwise conform to the rules for Medium Armor. The helmet must cover the top and back of the head, as well as the temples/ears. _(ie, the same areas a baseball batter's helmet covers, or an old timey leather football helmet).

Head coverings that will NOT qualify: Sombreros, baseball caps, cavalier's hats (ie 3 Musketeers-style hats), cloth hats.


### Armor Example

>Example: Spurt the Kobold has purchased enough Armor Training to raise their total Armor Cap to 40 points.
* They have not purchased any ranks in Dexterity Armor, and so they must wear a phys rep of all their armor.
* Spurt is wearing a chain shirt (16 points), hard leather greaves (12 points), and hard leather pauldrons (12 points)
* Spurt possesses an Armor Tag for 40 points of Armor.

Altogether, Spurt is wearing a total of 40 Armor Points, and has an Armor Cap of 40, which means they are able to use all of their Armor Points during combat.

# Spell / Arrow / Alchemy Packets

---
* There are no type = color requirements.  However, there is a strong preference for white, as they are far easier to find.
* Wet, torn, or damaged packets should be discarded rather than returned to the NPC Camp packet bucket.
* A packet can hit you anywhere, and it counts (including clothing). Weapons that strike your head, groin, or a hand holding a weapon do not count.
* When creating packets, an ideal cut size for the fabric is between 4"x4" to 6"x6".
* The approximate amount of seed inside a packet is between 1/2 tbsp to 1 tbsp depending on the type of seed you use.  The resulting packet should not be so large that it cannot fit into a standard film canister (33 mm/ 1.3 inch).
* Do not use birdseed with sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.

### Packet Crafting Materials
* **Fabric**: Cut or uncut white fabric that is a biodegradable natural fiber fabric. (Cotton, abaca, bamboo, lyocell, ramie, jute, hemp, silk.)  Please do not donate nylon, fleece, acrylic, polyester, or rayon fabrics for packets.
* **Rubber bands**: Size #32-33 is preferred (1/8"). Must be natural rubber.
* **Birdseed**: Millet bird seed or bird seed that does **not** contain sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.


# Combat Rules

## Armor: Immunities

In the event that the player are hit by an ability that they are immune to, their armor does not take the damage.

## Armor: Receiving Damage

During combat, when damage is taken by a character, it is first deducted from the Armor Point total, unless otherwise stated by a specific spell or skill. If the player still has Armor Points remaining, it does not matter which location is covered by armor, they will still deduct the damage from their remaining points.

## Bows and Crossbows: Blocking

Bows may be used to block attacks.  Bows may also be used to block attacks while wielding a One-Handed Weapon, so long as the skills One-Handed Weapons, Ranged Weapons, and Dual Wield are purchased.  If struck by an attack, the player must spend a 3 count to restring the bow before they may fire with it again _(See: Warbow)_.  

## Casting Spells

Casting a spell is an act of will and physical effort combined, gathering the energy that the caster has prepared in their memory and then throwing it out into the world. In LARP Chronicles, a spell's energy is represented by a "spell packet", a small bundle of cloth, usually filled with bird seed, that is thrown at, or touched against other participants, in order to use magic.

When casting a spell, first a player must have a spell packet in a free hand. Then, they cast the spell by speaking the entire incant or verbal (as specified by each spell), then throwing the packet, swinging their weapon (in the case of Spell Strikes), or touching the packet to their target (in the case of touch casting). If the spell packet or weapon strikes a target successfully, they are affected as per the spell's description, unless they are capable of resisting the magic. 

A spell or magic ability delivered via packet or Spell Strike successfully lands on the target if the packet or weapon phys rep makes contact with any part of the target's body, clothing, held items, or possessions.

A "Free Hand" in this instance means that the hand holding the spell packet may not be holding any other items. I.E., no swords, shields, potions, sticks, bedrolls, snack cakes, and such. A player may hold multiple spell packets in the same hand and still cast.

If a caster's spell incant or throw is disrupted, the Mana Points (or ability) used to cast the spell are lost the same as though it were successfully cast.  Taking damage does not interrupt a cast, however, effects that would prevent spellcasting (such as Stun, or being dead) can interrupt the casting of a spell. 

If a player accidentally or mistakenly fails to correctly incant a spell or ability, the spell or ability does not work. The Mana Points or ability used to cast the spell are not expended, and the caster simply has to start over with casting the spell. This is a "good faith" policy, and intentional abuse of this policy may be met with disciplinary action as per the Chronicles Code of Conduct.   

Some spells require a "X count" to cast where X may be three or five.  This is always intended to be X number of seconds.

## Ability Verbals and Damage Calls
Verbals have two different forms, _Damage Calls_ and Ability or Effect Verbals. 

Damage Calls always begin with a number (such as _5 Normal_), and anything that begins with a number is always a Weapon Blow. They will always take the form of `<Damage Amount> <Damage Type> <Carrier(optional)>`. 
 
Ability verbals have two components: Delivery Type, and Effect. They will always take the form of `<Delivery Type> <Effect>`.

### Delivery Methods
The Delivery Method is how a _player_ conveys an ability or effect. It is the real world, physical object used. _(ie, the fabric and birdseed packet, or latex-covered foam.)_

Delivery Methods are one of:
- Weapon Physrep
- Packet
- Potion Physrep
- Voice Radius†

It is possible for abilities and weapon blows to be delivered via any Delivery Method (as specified by the skills of the character using the ability).

_† Not strictly a physical object, but you get the idea_

### Delivery Types
The Delivery Type of an ability verbal is the means by which a _character_ conveys an ability or effect. It is the fantasy, in-world object or energy the character is wielding. _(ie, a bolt of magical energy, a vial of poison, a steel sword, a wooden arrow, etc.)_

Delivery Types can be:
- Physical
- Physical Strike
- Magic (or spell incant)
- Spell Strike
- Toxin
- Toxin Strike
- Aether
- Aether Strike
- Weapon Blows†

### Damage Calls
Directly dealing damage requires a weapon blow. There are three components to a damage call: the Damage Amount, Damage Type, and (optionally) the Carrier.

> Examples of damage calls:
> 5 Normal
> 3 Magic Flame
> 10 Poison Sleep

#### Damage Amount
Generally, this amount is calculated based on the number of relevant Weapon Proficiencies and Backstabs the character has (though it can be modified by some skills and abilities). It is the amount of damage that will be inflicted to target should the attack be successful. The Damage Amount may never be less than 0.  

#### Damage Type
There are 5 Damage Types:

- Normal
- Silver
- Poison
- Magic
- Aether

Some creatures may immune or resistant to certain damage types _(such as werewolves, which are immune to Normal, Poison, and Magic, thus requiring a Silvered weapon to deal damage to them)_.

Aether is an exceptionally rare damage type. Active defenses cannot be used to defend against Weapon blows delivered with the "Aether" damage type _(ie, they cannot be Resisted or Dodged). They can be blocked with a weapon or shield like any other weapon blow, however.

By default, all weapons use the Normal damage type. However, _Aura_ abilities may grant characters or specific items the ability to utilize other damage types. 

Items that have an aura property _must_ swing for that damage type, unless superceded by another explicitly-stated effect (such as a character with a Monstrous Aura ability).

#### Carriers
Carriers impart the named effect to the target is the weapon blow successfully reduces the target's current body points. 

Unless explicitly stated, a character is always able to drop their carrier from their weapon blows. Only one carrier may be used per weapon blow, so even if the character has many carrier abilities, they may only use at most 1 per swing.
>Example: Leonardo the Lich has Monstrous Carrier: Drain and Monstrous Carrier: Stun. Bob can choose to swing 5 Magic, OR 5 Magic Drain, OR 5 Magic Stun. Leonardo cannot swing 5 Magic Drain Stun.

Note: Abilities and effects that cause damage can never function as Damage Carriers.

#### Damage Call Examples
> Example: 
> Anduvius the Adventurer has a normal longsword, a transform with the Magic Aura and Flame Aura abilities, and a Frost coating applied to the weapon. Anduvius can choose to deliver any of the following weapon blows:
> * 5 Magic
> * 5 Normal
> * 5 Magic Flame
> * 5 Normal Flame
> * 5 Magic Frost
> * 5 Normal Frost

> Example:
> Velma the Vampire Hunter has a silvered long sword. They may only swing 5 Silver with it. If they wish to swing 5 Normal, they must use a different weapon.

> Example:  
> Gygax the Golem has the transform ability Monstrous Silver Aura. While wielding a normal Long Sword, Gygax may choose to swing 5 Normal OR 5 Silver, at his discretion.

> Example:    
> Miracle Max has the ability Monstrous Poison Aura and a long sword enchanted with Magic Aura. Max may only choose to swing 5 Poison OR 5 Magic with that sword.
  
> Example:  
> Archibald the Artificer has a silvered short sword. He decides to use his artificing skill to enchant the sword with a Magic Aura. The resulting weapon is no longer considered silvered, and will only have Magic Aura on the item tag.


## Defense Slots

Using any skill, ability, or effect that grants a Resist or Dodge requires a Defense Slot to be prepared.  All characters have one Defense Slot by default and may purchase additional slots with Skill Points.  Each Defense Slot a character may prepare and consider active.  A character may only have as many Active Defenses as they have Defense Slots.  Once prepared, any Active Defense may be used to defend against the appropriate type of attack, allowing them to call Resist or Dodge respectively.

### Healed By [Effect]
When you have an ability or active effect that makes you take Healed By an effect. For example: Shock, Stone, Flame, or Frost.  Creatures with this ability cannot be healed by weapon attacks (except Spellstrikes), but can be healed by packet attacks. 

Examples:  
You are healed by Frost.
* If you are hit with a spell "I conjure a Frost Bolt 10." Or "Spellstrike I conjure a Frost Bolt 10" you would say "Got it, appears to heal me" and restore up to 10 body (if you are below your maximum body).
* If you are hit with an "Aether Frost Bolt 10" you would call "Got it, appears to heal me".
* If you are hit with a sword and someone says "10 Magic Frost" the call would be "Got it" and you would take the damage as normally.


### Immunities

When you have an inherent ability or active effect that makes you explicitly immune to an effect you call "No Effect" if you are hit by a spell or weapon carrier using that effect.  If you are immune to part of the weapon damage call then you are immune to all of it.  The exception to this would Stasis or other abilities that explicitly state the things to which you become immune (and that call should always be, "No effect; Visibly in Stasis").

Examples:
* If you have Immune to Toxin, and you are hit by a Sleep dart, you would call "No Effect".
* If you are Immune to Curse and got hit with a weapon swinging 10 Magic Curse, you would call "No Effect".
* If you are Immune to Shock and got hit with an "Aether Shock Bolt 10" you would call "No Effect".
* If you are not immune to Stun, and you get hit by a Stun spell, you would call "Got it". If you are then hit by another Stun effect, you would call "Got it" again.
* If you are a PC with no non-standard effects, are not dead, and get hit by a Create Undead, you would call "Got it".
* If you do not have Immune to Life on your stat card, are alive, and get hit by a Life spell, you would call "Got it".
* If you are dead and get hit by a Death spell, you call "Got it".
* If you are Dead, and you get hit by a Heal Wounds, Confine, etc., you would call "Got it"

## Killing Blows

Killing Blow is a 3-count that can be interrupted. When Killing Blowed, the target becomes Dead. Killing Blow 1, Killing Blow 2, Killing Blow 3 <Damage Type or Spell>.

A weapon or other object is not required to perform a Killing Blow _(it is possible to deliver a Killing Blow barehanded)_. The damage type of a Killing Blow is always "Normal", unless delivered with a weapon or character that is capable of swinging a different damage type.

In lieu of a damage type, a character may also use a spell to perform a Killing Blow. 
> Ex: Killing Blow 1, Killing Blow 2, Killing Blow 3 I conjure a flame bolt 10

The target of a killing blow may refuse it, so long as they are capable of movement.  Any killing blow is assumed to automatically be refused by a target capable of movement, unless explicitly accepted by the target.

## Magic Deliverance, Voice Radius, and Aether

Rarely, one may encounter entities that are capable of delivering magic quicker than normal, skipping the incantation and abridging it to simply Magic followed by the spell name, for example, Magic Fear. This is still an effective spell and needs to be reacted to as such.  Casting via magic deliverance is still subject to all other casting requirements such as utilizing packets, finishing the call before throwing their packet, etc.  Magic deliverance does not grant immunity to the silence effect.

Similarly, some entities may deliver a spell via "Voice Radius," at which time anyone who can hear the declared spell, whether enemy or ally, is subject to it as if they'd been struck by the spell directly. This ability does not require the caster to have a spell packet in hand.

Finally, powerful creatures can sometimes deliver a spell as an Aether spell. If a player is struck by an Aether spell, no resistances can prevent the effect, and they are affected by it immediately.

## Physical Strikes

Physical strikes are weapon delivered combat effects used by characters. A physical strike is delivered once using a weapon attack, and must strike the target character successfully without being blocked in order to be a successful attack. Physical strikes are considered used whether the attack was successful or not. Physical strikes that are blocked by shields or weapons, have been blocked and are considered unsuccessful attacks. Unsuccessful physical strikes and physical strikes that have been resisted can be regained by the character resting. Physical strike effects are not magical in nature; therefore, they cannot be removed by the Dispel Magic spell or any removal skill that is limited to effects of magical origin only.

## Shields

The maximum surface area of a shield is 720 square inches. The longest dimension a shield may have is 36".

As long as the character has either hand on a shield, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the shield is considered effectively blocked.

Limitations:
* A shield may never be used for striking in combat. 
* Shields may not be used with two-handed weapons, bows, or crossbows.
* A character may not dual wield shields.
* Shields are not capable of blocking spell packets or toxins without the use of an ability.

## Spell Packets

Anything in a player's possession being struck by a spell causes them to take the effect of the spell, even if it is an illegal strike zone.  If illegal strike zones are being targeted repeatedly, inform Plot or a member of Staff immediately.


### Spellstrikes

Spellstrikes are spells cast upon a target via a physically represented weapon.  Spellstrikes may not be refused in the way touch casts can.  Active defenses that apply to packet-delivered spells may also apply to Spell Strike-delivered spells (such as Resist Magic).  The Parry skill will not defend against the effect of a Spellstrike.  If a player physically parries a Spellstrike, they take the effect of the spell. An individual capable of using Spellstrike may treat a wielded weapon as a spell packet for the purposes of touch-casting. Packets may not be used to Spellstrike.
	
### Touch-Casting

Touch-casting does not require physical contact, but it does require the proximity that physical contact could be established.  Be sure to gain a player's consent prior to physically touching them.   If a player is touch-casting, they are either touching the target directly with a spell packet or pointing at the target while holding a spell packet. 

The target has the ability to "refuse your touch-cast", causing the player to expend the magic to no effect.  Any spell may be touch-cast. The target of a touch-cast spell may refuse the touch-cast, so long as they are capable of movement. Any and every offensive or negative touch-cast spell is assumed to automatically be refused unless explicitly accepted by the target.
# Combat Etiquette

---
Keeping combatants around can be difficult without an agreement on how combat "works". The mechanics of combat on paper are a very different topic from the out-of-game social workings players follow. Below are several social agreements between combatants that are generally adhered to. If clarity is needed beyond this consult a fellow player, if clarity still eludes you then you should ask a marshal.  Violation of these rules may result in disciplinary protocols, however, please also keep in mind honest accidents happen. Other players are people and the level of contact we play at needs to be mutually regulated.

## Players Not Observing Etiquette
In the event there is a player that you believe is not following combat etiquette, if you are comfortable doing so, politely remind them about the rule they are violating.  Additionally, always inform the person running the mod/plot/staff about the instance, even if it was only once. 

## Light Touch
When contacting others with your weapon, you need only make the barest of contact. If you are hearing loud noises when you hit others or their equipment, equipment is regularly breaking when you use it, or other players seem frequently disgruntled then odds are you are swinging too hard. You can be fast without hitting hard, and you need not follow through on a swing. Your attacks should look and feel like a game of tag, not a game of football. It is also possible to be proactive and ask for feedback from fellow players on the frequency, intensity, and locations you're striking.

## Strike Zones
Strike locations are zones that are reasonable to aim for, target, and strike with marshal-approved equipment (see Weapon Safety Check). Players found to be intentionally targeting non-strike zones will face disciplinary action. 

For melee weapons limit striking to the carried melee equipment (weapons and shields), torso, hands, arms, feet, and legs; while avoiding contact with the head and groin. Intentionally targeting outside of these zones with melee weapons will draw the attention of players, and staff, and initiate disciplinary protocols. If there is contact with out-of-bounds zones, ensure that your fellow player is okay to continue, ask if they need a moment, and proceed accordingly.

Dialogue example:
*P1 hits P2 in the head.* 
P1: "Hey are you okay?" 
P2: "Yes, just a bit rattled."
P1: "Are you good to continue?"
P2: "No…"
P1: "Do I need to get staff?"
P2: "No, I'll be good in a minute."
P1: "Okay, have a seat and get some water, I'm going to carry on elsewhere. Jump back in when you're ready."

Striking with packets is slightly different. Packets do not carry the mass or inertia that melee weapons do. If struck in the head or groin packets will still count as valid. Players who target these areas should expect disciplinary measures.

In the event of any incidental / accidental illegal contact briefly pause to ensure the health and safety of fellow players.

## Speed of Combat
Combat itself moves quickly but also involves doing some level of math and discussion. It is important to be clear with other players about what is happening. Blitzing someone with calls will cause more confusion than clear concise calls paced steadily. Limit your swings to one swing per second per weapon (Don't swing faster than your calls.) You can only swing as fast as you make intelligible calls (Complete your call clearly before swinging again.) 

## Charging
Charging refers to a player's proximity to another player in melee combat. In combat, combatants should never be inside the physical reach another combatant. Combatants should not be able to make skin to skin contact.

Charging unfairly prevents one combatant from attacking their combat partner.
Charging can prevent a combatant from being able to attack safely and can result in players being struck in illegal strike zones or injuries to areas such as the eyes.
Charging forces one combatant to backpedal or retreat. We often play on uneven ground and this could result in a player tripping and sustaining injuries.

## Fighting in Tight Settings
We need to be mindful of our setting when engaging in combat. This is especially true if we are inside fighting around a wall or trying to engage in narrow spaces between buildings. If you can't see your target, don't swing. If there are things on the wall near you, bring it to the attention of other players and move the combat elsewhere. 

## Trapping
A weapon may never be used to entrap or immobilize an opponent's weapon. This does not prohibit impediment of another player's weapon (parrying, blocking, etc).

## Turtling
Turtling is the act of occluding all valid strike zones, while in melee combat, from an opponent through the combined use of a shield and/or other objects. This includes contorting behind a shield, standing across a table from an opponent, and shielding your top half. An opponent should have at least one option to strike you without engaging in unsafe behavior.

## Weapon on Weapon
If in the course of a swing your weapon touches your opponent's weapon before it contacts your opponents strike zones, it is considered blocked.

## Weapon Safety Checks
Weapon safety checks will be administered by marshals at check-in. They are feeling for weakened/broken down foam and inspecting weapon cores for integrity. Marshals are charged with the safety of the game and its players and have the final say. If none of your weapon reps pass the safety check, you may speak with staff about borrowing a rep from NPC Camp.  Repeatedly borrowing reps from NPC Camp will result in fees charged in gold.


## Headbands
### Orange Headbands - Non Combatants & Pages
Pages are people that are unable to enter combat.  They may be children or adults, although any child under age 14 must be a Page.  Pages may not use combat skills, weapons, or throw packets.

**You may not ever physically strike a Page.**  If you engage in combat with a page, you may point your weapon or packet and say, "Page, I kill you."  They cannot participate in combat.  They are treated as if they have 1 body.

### White Headbands - Out of Game
Once you arrive on site, you are entering an In Game Area.  If you are not in game as your character yet, you must have a white headband on.  If you do not have a white headband, you may request one from staff.  If there are none available, you may signify your out of game status by holding a hand to your forehead or touching the top of your head with a held item.  This gesture is accepted as an out of character signal and frequently used by NPCs when not in game.

If you are in game, you should not react or speak to anyone that is wearing a white headband without first going out of game yourself.  It is generally seen as poor etiquette to break the environment for others.

When your character dies and your dying count has expired, after dropping all in game items, you should put on a white headband and go to Logistics/NPC Camp to register your death.  Your spirit cannot interact in any manner with others.


## Communication is Your Greatest Weapon
A lot of communication happens to make this game run. Some spells have longer incantations so that monsters and players can see the wind up. Chances are if a player is attempting to affect another player or npc they will need to project clearly. If you are unsure of what just happened in combat, ask questions!  Ideally, this is done quietly with your combat partner or someone nearby to not disrupt the game environment.  In the heat of combat, it is not uncommon for someone to place a hand on their head to signify an out of character moment and then ask for clarification. Most will happily explain or repeat. This is because, universally, players can only take the effects they are aware of.

## "Lay on!"
This is the call from STAFF that the game is beginning to move after some situation in which there has been a pause. It's not uncommon to hear this after a scene is verbally set by staff, or a rules question has derailed more than a couple people.

## Hold!
Someone shouting "HOLD!" is the specific agreed-upon signal for all combat and gameplay to stop, it is important that you do not move your feet when this happens. Anyone can call a hold. Players, unless they are no longer able to call hold, should only call holds for themselves. When they are fit to do so, they will be the one to resume play by calling "Lay On!" as described above.

When this happens you need to pay attention to what is going on around you. Stop all activity, movement, and be silent unless directed otherwise.  Do not move, "step out of the way", or kneel down, because you never know when a hold was called because someone's glasses are in danger of being crushed.

This call is the signal that someone is in a precarious position, or possibly hurt. Let the folks with first-aid training get through. While it is rare that this call gets made, it does happen. 

Staff may also call a hold to narrate or describe a scene, or things happening to/around your character.

To that end: Avoid in-character/game interactions where you loudly shout "HOLD."  "Desist," "Stop," and "Proceed no further," convey the same message and do not cause the game to grind to a halt. Asking someone lowly to "hold this for safe keeping," or asking if you can "hold a meeting" are fine. "HOLD," said at a certain volume and urgency are the signs to stop, and make sure everyone is okay before play resumes only when staff declares "Lay on!"

## Medic v Healer
If you hear anyone call "Medic" you must immediately stop all activity, movement, and be silent unless directed otherwise.  If you are physically able to, drop to one knee.  **These calls indicate an Out of Game emergency.**  Please do not call "Medic" unless you or someone else is injured in real life.

Only the persons who have been identified as a Medic by staff should respond to the call of "Medic."  A Medic is an individual with CPR and/or First Aid certification or has a license to practice medicine.  

Medic = A real-life person is physically injured.
> In the event that my adventuring partner is wounded in glorious combat against a horde of mice, I call for a "Healer!"

Healer = You need to restore Body or health points.
> In the event that my friend Jon has twisted his ankle badly, Jon should call for a "Medic!"  Do not call Medic for someone else unless they are unable to do so.

This is an important distinction, and if there is any confusion please ask someone to explain further.

# Life & Death

## Body _(aka Health Points)_

---
Body is the measurement of a character's state of health, and is often referred to as "Health Points" or "Hit Points" in many RPG systems. All characters start with 10 Body, and gain more via the Toughness skill. Receiving any amount of Damage reduces the character's current Body. They can receive healing effects to increase their Body after taking Damage, but healing may never put them above their Maximum Body.


## Alive

---
Any character with 1 or more current Body is Alive.


## Unconscious

---
A character whose current Body is exactly 0 is considered Unconscious. A character who is Unconscious is unable to take any actions that require active thought or movement, and the character is considered helpless. Being Unconscious lasts for 1 minute, at the end of which time the character is returned to consciousness with 1 Body. If a character takes any additional damage while at 0 and Unconscious, they proceed to begin Bleeding Out.


## Bleeding Out (aka Dying)

---
A character who has their current Body reduced to -1 is considered Bleeding Out. A character cannot be reduced to below -1 Body, regardless of the amount of damage taken.

Bleeding Out lasts for 1 minute, during which the character is unconscious and may not make any game actions that require consciousness. Any amount of healing will restore the character's Body by the amount stated by the healing effect, and they will no longer be Bleeding Out.

Receiving First Aid will pause the dying count until the First Aid is completed or the character performing the First Aid is interrupted, at which point the Dying character will either be at 0 body, Unconscious, or their Bleeding Out count will resume at its previous count.

After 1 minute of Bleeding Out, the character dies and is now Dead.

_(Ex: Bob is Bleeding Out. Thirty seconds into Bleeding Out, Charlie heals Bob for 10 body. Bob is now conscious, able to act again, and has 9 body.)_


## Dead

---
A character that goes 1 minute of Bleeding Out without receiving any healing or First Aid, or who is affected by some other Death effect, becomes Dead.

Death lasts for 5 minutes, at which point, the character's body dissipates, and their spirit departs and travels to a Shrine of Resurrection. The player announces, "Body dissipates," any in-game items the character possesses when they dissipate are dropped to the ground, the player puts on a white headband and goes Out-Of-Game, and should seek out a marshal (either the marshal of the mod, or NPC camp) to seek resurrection.

While Dead, a character is not aware of their surroundings, and may not make any game actions, move, speak, be affected by any effect that reduces or heals Body Points, or be affected by any effect that does not specifically target Dead bodies.

During the 5 minutes the character is Dead, if they receive a Life spell or Revivify spell, they become Alive as per the spell or effect they receive.

Any spells or effects that were present on the character when they became DEAD are lost. This does not include active defenses, permanent effects, or other effects which explicitly state persistence through Death. This does include temporary spell buffs, Conjured Weapons, and status effects.  


## Spirits

---
The spirit of a character is the essence of that person. Spirits are always Out Of Game, and may not interact with or be aware of the In-Game world, and In Game characters may only interact with spirits within a Shrine of Resurrection or while under an effect that explicitly states that they may do so.


## Resurrection

---
A character who has passed their 5 minute Death count dissipates, and their spirit will depart to seek Resurrection. If the spirit, as an Out-of-Game decision, believes that an ally may come and attempt to Resurrect them using the Rank IX Spirit Spell Resurrection, then they may linger for a time. If they do not, then the spirit will depart it's current location to seek the nearest safe Shrine of Resurrection. The knowledge of whether a specific Shrine is "Safe" or not is entirely OOG knowledge, but a Spirit will never Resurrect at an unsafe Shrine. When a Spirit Resurrects, they will incur SP Debt, explained below.

When a player resurrects all Non-Ritual effects are removed unless otherwise told by Plot.

Any player may choose to have their character dissipate at any time, for any reason, and then immediately seek resurrection unless they are hit with a decimate effect.  This can be used to refuse effects including those delivered by a killing blow (except decimate).  This is an OOG decision and the player does not need to explain their decisions. 

## Skill Point Debt
When a character resurrects, they incur SP Debt, which results in a portion of the character's SP becoming temporarily unavailable to be used. 

**Total Debt**: SP that is held "in debt", unable to be use by the character.  
**Total SP**: The total amount of SP the character has. This number is **not** affected by SP Debt in any way, and continues to increase normally as the player attends events.  
**Effective SP**: The amount of SP available to the character to spend on skills. Equal to `Total SP - Total Debt`   

The character does not permanently lose SP, and having an SP Debt does not affect how the character gains Total SP. SP Debt is not calculated until **after** an event; **a player will not need to rewrite their character or drop skills in the middle of an event because of SP Debt.**

After every event a player attends, any SP Debt they have is reduced by 25% (minimum 3) of their Total Debt. Then, if that character died during the event, their debt is increased by 5% (rounded down) of their Effective SP for every death they incurred.  After this, if the character's Total Debt is greater than 25% of their Total SP, the character permanently dies.

### Post-Event SP Calculation
```
1) Pay off old debt: New Total Debt = 75% of Total Debt [rounded down] (aka, reduce Total Debt by 25%)		
2) Calculate New Debt Incurred: Add 5% of Effective SP to Total Debt for each Death during the event			
3) Gain SP for the event: Add SP gained to Total SP			
4) Calculate New Effective SP (Total SP - Total Debt)
```

#### SP Debt Example
> Octoro the Orc begins a 2-day weekend event with 300 SP. They resurrect once during the event. After the event, they will incur a debt of 15 SP (300 * .05). They will gain 6 SP for the event. Octoro now has:
> Total SP: 306
> Total Debt: 15
> Effective SP: 291
> So, at the beginning of the next event Octoro the Orc attends, they will only be able to utilize up to 291 SP to purchase skills.
> 
> At the next event Octoro the Orc attends, they do not resurrect. After the event, their debt will be reduced by 4. (15 Total Debt .25, rounded up). Octoro the Orc now has:
> Total SP: 312
> Total Debt: 11
> Effective SP: 301
> 
> At their third event, Octoro the Orc ressurects again. After the event, their debt is first reduced by 3. Then, they incur 15 addition debt `(312 Total SP - 8 Debt) * .05 = 15`, bringing their Total Debt to 23. Octoro now has:
> Total SP: 318
> Total Debt: 23
> Effective SP: 295

## Permanent Death

---
A character who is permanently dead may no longer be returned to life by any means. The Player of a **Permanently Dead** character may then allocate 75%, rounded up, of the accumulated SP of the **Permanently Dead** character into a new Character, or promote their secondary character to their primary status with 75%, rounded up, of the accumulated SP of the now **Permanently Dead** character.

If a player creates a new character.  The secondary and tertiary characters SP will be recalculated based off the new primary character's total. 

Only the Primary Character can receive Permanent Death. 

## Retiring a Character

Have you slayed your families' killers, wiped out those pesky goblins, or even ascended into Godhood?  If so, you may feel that your character's arc has ended, or perhaps a situation has arisen where it is no longer fun to play the character, and it is time to hang up their boots.   With Plot's approval you may retire your character and allocate 100% of the XP to a new character or promote another with no XP loss.

## Killing Blow

---
Killing Blow is a 3-count that can be interrupted. When Killing Blowed, the target becomes **Dead**. _Killing Blow 1, Killing Blow 2, Killing Blow 3 &lt;type>_.  The target of a killing blow may refuse it, so long as they are capable of movement.  Any killing blow is assumed to automatically be refused by a target capable of movement, unless explicitly accepted by the target.


## Dismemberment & Body Smuggling

---
A character whose body has been dismembered while **Bleeding Out** or **Dead** may still be healed or revived. The part of the character that can be so affected is represented by and located wherever the player of that character is. The spirit-containing body of a character may be carried by another character, however, the person carrying the body may not run or move faster than the player of the character being carried.

Dismembering a character for the purpose of attempting to use a smaller body part to heal, revive, or even hide the character is not any different than if the character were not dismembered. If a character is **Bleeding Out** or **Dead** and someone wishes to bring that character to a healer, or move the body away from where it fell, they may role-play carrying the body by picking it up on a three count _(ex: "One I pick you up… Two I pick you up… Three I pick you up…")_ and carrying it elsewhere. The carrying player may not run, and both players must roleplay maintaining contact and remain within arm's reach of each other. If any effect would forcibly move the carrier away at a pace faster than a walk, or would otherwise render them unable to hold game items in their hands, the character must drop the body on a One Count _(ex: "One I drop you")_ and may only resume carrying them on a new three count.

## Metabolisms
Most people and creatures have a regular metabolism. Characters with "no metabolism" or "undead metabolism" are affected by some game effects differently:

### No Metabolism
- **Crumble at 0 Body** _(When the character reaches 0 or fewer Body Points, they immediately dissipate and seek resurrection.)_
- Immune to Toxin
- Immune to Berserk, Command: Confuse, Death, Boon of Nature, Drain, First Aid, Heal Wounds, Hearthstone, Infect, Life, Regenerate, Revive, Revivify, Sleep, Stun, Vampiric Touch, Waylay

> _Generally, a creature that has no metabolism cannot be healed by typical means, but will have an alternate method of being healed. For instance, a Fire Elemental would be immune to standard healing effects, but could be healed by Flame._ 

### Undead Metabolism
Creatures with Undead Metabolism follow the same rules as "No Metabolism," with the excpetions that they are affected by Heal Wounds (and other standard healing effects) normally, as well as being affected by effects and abilities that specifically target undead (such as Harm Undead).

## Spirit Bottle
A character with a Spirit Bottle has stored their spirit for safe keeping in an item. Doing so protects the character from incurring SP Debt, however, it causes the character's body to become brittle. All characters with a Spirit Bottle must crumble at 0 body, and unless otherwise specified, have No Metabolism.

Instead of resurrecting normally, a character with a Spirit Bottle may choose to reform at their Spirit Bottle. Doing so follows the rules for normal resurrection, with these exceptions:
- Instead of incurring SP Debt, the number of charges on the character's Spirit Bottle is reduced by 1.
- The character may only reform wherever their Spirit Bottle is located

When initially created, a Spirit Bottle has 10 charges. If, at any time, the Spirit Bottle is reduced to 0 charges, it can no longer be used to reform. A character with a Spirit Bottle that has 0 charges still crumbles at 0 body, but must resurrect (and incur SP Debt) normally.

Spirit Bottles may have their charges replenished. Doing so requires the casting of the Spirit Bottle ritual. A Spirit Bottle cannot have more than 10 charges.

## Brood

**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ****  
RP     *****
```

**Physical Description**:

Brood may appear with iridescent brown complexions with varied color markings, carapaces, and large claws.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 1 Year.


**Median Life Expectancy**: 9 Years.


**Maximum Lifespan**: 30 Years.


**Overview**:

Initially, all Brood were connected to each other through the Hive Mind and were drones with no distinctiveness of personality.  Beginning with a single Brood, the concept of individualism began to spread, and with it, a disconnect from the Hive Mind.  Many Brood were not able to withstand being severed from the Hive this way and did not survive.


Those that did were able to act with autonomy, adopted their own names, and continually sought ways to express their newfound individuality.  The Brood began painting and marking themselves with various colors and using this to create distinct appearances and a stronger sense of identity for themselves.


Overall, other races regard the Brood as a terrifying race capable of great destruction and the majority are unaware of any difference between the two types of Brood.  As their presence is likely to typically cause alarm and panic, it is incredibly rare to see one of these Brood within a town.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Rip Free*: _Brood abhor the sensation of being trapped and when they find themselves in such a situation, they will do anything in their power to regain their freedom._ Once per rest, a Brood may have one free usage of Escape Artist.


*Acidic Secretion*:  _Along with being capable of great destruction in general, Brood have acidic blood that is capable of destroying items._  Once per day, a Brood character may spend 1 minute in concentration to gain a single `Physical Rebound Physical Destroy` defense.  This acts as per Rebound, and requires an open defense slot.


**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  All Brood player characters must use a different colored paint to add markings and may not only have brown or black paint.  The design and color of these markings is player choice.  Physical representations for the carapace should be present and may be colored brown or black and given an iridescent coating.

## Dwarf

**Physical Description**:

Dwarves appear with complexions ranging from pale to ebony and are commonly recognized by their full-beards and great, bushy eyebrows.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 30 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 150 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  250 Years.

**Overview**:

The Dwarven people of Evren are a sturdy race of people who hail from the mountainous regions.  Rarely given toward verbosity or activities they believe are unrefined and requiring improvement, Dwarves have received a reputation of being brusque and hypercritical.

This race once ruled a wide part of Evren with many villages filled with fantastic creations of ingenuity and inspired design.  Over half a millenia ago, when the Iblis invaded Evren, the Dwarven people suffered greatly, and lost control over much of their territories and their bastion of knowledge.  In the counter-attacks that ultimately pushed the Iblis back, the Dwarves were indispensable for their crafters.  Now, generations later, none truly remember the losses of their ancestors, and have long since turned their focus back toward building a vast mining empire and achieving ever greater levels of craftsmanship.


**Racial Abilities**:


*Body of Stone*: _Hardy and strong, Dwarves have a natural ability to overcome certain effects._ Once per rest, a Dwarf may MINIMIZE a single 20 second Physical effect with a 3 second count by incanting, "Minimize Physical."


*Tricks of the Trade*: _Dwarves are masters of all things crafting, and as such have learned how to cut the occasional corner._ Once per day, a Dwarf may add 1 additional Durability to an item that is being created by themselves or another crafter.


**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Both male and female Dwarves appear with beards.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 50 Years.


**Median Life Expectancy**: 225 Years.


**Maximum Lifespan**:  250-300 Years.


**Racial Abilities**:


*Will of Ages*: _Their long lives and vibrant life force makes them particularly resistant to negative spell effects._ Once per rest, an Elf may reduce a Spell Effect upon themselves to three seconds by incanting, "Minimize Spell"


*Ritual Expertise*: _The longevity of the Elves means that they often are able to find improvements in otherwise flawed Rituals_. Once per day, an Elf may reduce the Spirit Gem cost of a single ritual, to a minimum of one Spirit Gem. A single Ritual may not benefit from this ability more than once.


### Dark Elf

**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ***  
RP     ***
```
**Physical Description**:

Dark Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from white to pale.  They can sometimes be recognized by red markings around their eyes.

**Overview**:

The Dark Elven people primarily live deep below the surface of Evren.  Built within expansive networks of subterranean tunnels and caverns, their cities are elaborate and intricate wonders constructed long ago with a unique material that gives their constructions a glossy appearance like polished obsidian, but is much less brittle.

The Dark Elves themselves are known to be a bit xenophobic or isolationist, depending on the viewpoint. Socially, they are organized into matriarchal Houses.  Within their culture, the House you are born to or employed by is typically an indicator of overall status, as some are much more affluent  and influencing than others.

A Dark Elf with no such House affiliation is akin to an unknown.  In more polite circles, the avoidance of interaction is reasoned as not knowing how to properly address or interact with the Houseless individual, Elf or not.  More commonly, anyone lacking a House affiliation is generally seen as a non-citizen and thought to be a creature of no consequence with little to no importance and not worth direct attention.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  If a paler complexion is desired, it is recommended to use a lighter makeup foundation rather than to rely on white paint.  For the red eye markings, how they are added is player discretion and may be as simple as smudges, red eye-liner, lines, red eyeshadow, or no red markings at all.



### High Elf

**Physical Description**:

High Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from fair to ebony.

**Overview**:

High Elves are one of the most common Elves found in Evren.  Being more abundant across Evren, it should come as no surprise that these Elves frequently break down into regional or political groups such as Elves in the Red Desert often being referred to as "Desert Elves."

The High Elves are typically perceived by others to be snobbish or elitist.  The reality of this is that they probably are.  Most, if accused of being elitist, would more than likely assert this as truth, as to deny it, in their views, would be akin to the delusion that High Elves are not superior to other Elves that, while Elf-shaped, are far too primitive and barbaric.

The majority of Moon Elves call Southwood home and live in a sprawling city where many buildings seem to have been grown from only silver and moonstone.

A widely held belief among the Moon Elves explains their practice of staining their skin silver: The Great Mother and Great Father formed the Elven race long ago, and in the birth of their race, the Mother's form exploded, becoming the stars in the night sky.  Forlorn without her, the Father transformed himself into the moon and joined her in the sky, but found he could not gaze upon only his beloved.

The Father turned his face upon Evren, providing a guiding light for their children at night and casting a pale, watchful face over them in the daytime. Each month, he will slowly turn away and face only the Mother to share a private moment away from the eyes of their children.

During this time of darkness, the sap of the central tree within their city turns silver.  It has become the practice of these Elves, each month, to mark the skin of their infants during their first new moon.  Many Elves continue to mark and stain their skin with the sap throughout their life, to mark everything from a coming of age to achieving spiritual growth.  The time of a new moon is a sacred time to the Moon Elves, as they believe it is the only time the Father and the Mother may create life again.

Their temperaments are varied, though most present themselves as stoic individuals with a quiet seriousness.  This behavior can sometimes appear as an attitude of aloofness or reserve.  The illusion is typically broken by the presence of someone the Moon Elf knows, prompting them toward displaying sudden warmth and openness.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Silver markings are largely up to the player.  Some examples of this may be flecks, lines, or the only visible color of the complexion.



### Sun Elf  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ***  
RP     ***  
```
**Physical Description**:

Sun Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions ranging from tan to a rich golden color.  They are often recognized by a golden sheen resulting from staining.

**Overview**:

The Sun Elves can primarily be found throughout the many islands of the archipelago.  Traveling from island to island, these Elves have become experts at navigation and utilize a unique mapping technique to map ocean swells with esoteric creations of sticks. shells, and twine.  Equipped with these stick maps, the knowledge to read them, and their massive catamarans, the Sun Elves live a transient, seafaring life.

The golden complexion of Sun Elves began long ago with a misguided belief that a particular gold mica laden cream would protect their skin from the harshness of the sun – a necessity for a people frequently under it.  Living mostly in small communities that frequently intermix, it is no surprise that the use of gold mica laden creams has become ubiquitous.  Today, the Sun Elves continue the practice of staining their skin as part of their naming ceremony as infants or any various coming of age tradition.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Achieving the golden complexion of a Sun Elf can typically be done with Mehron products.  It is not suggested to apply glitter due to the possibility of it getting in the eyes.



### Wild Elf  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ***  
RP     **  
```

**Physical Description**:

Wild Elves appear with pointed ears and complexions from fair to ebony.  They are often recognized by visible markings or tattoos.

**Overview**:

Many of the Wild Elves – so named by the High Elves – make their homes either in Elven kingdoms or in the treetops of many Evren forests.  Regarded as masters of these untamed areas, they will frequently be referred to as rangers and are considered to be rather sneaky and elusive.  Equally, these Elves are frequently thought of as unnerving to face in a fight due to their use of ululating war cries.

The Wild Elves consider themselves to simply be better than others at living with nature and understanding its patterns rather than foolishly attempting to change nature to suit their own needs.  Even their homes, built upon platforms that sprawl from one tree to another, utilize the natural branching and existing foliage of the trees to support and camouflage their presence.

Socially, these Elves are broken down into various regional Groves, led by an elected council of five referred to as the Root.  Like the roots of a tree, the Root is responsible for supporting the Grove from the bottom up.  In an effort to maintain balance, each council member of the Root shares an equal say, which can sometimes result in changes as rapidly shifting as the weather or with a steady dependability.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Markings and tattoos can be done in any style desired by the player and in any color.


## Glimmerling

---  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup **  
RP     **  
```
**Physical Description**:

Glimmerlings appear with a variety of complexions.  They are sometimes recognized by horns, antennae, wings, pointed ears, large noses, additional eyes, tails, etc.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 18 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 120 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  200 Years.

**Overview**:

Old wives tales will claim the Glimmerling people are the result of Humans having intermingled with the Fae of ancient legend.  Just as those stories contain many different descriptions, so too are the Glimmerlings wildly diverse in appearance and temperament.

Most people view the Glimmerlings with no difference to how they view the fairies of folktales, which is to say, there is very little open trust granted and more than a little suspicion.  This is of course aided by the tendency of many Glimmerlings to be merciless, mischievous tricksters – though in their opinion, they are simply having some fun and don't all people like fun?

**Racial Abilities**:

*Remembrance*: _Being connected to the realm of dreams, Glimmerlings are able to delve into the memories of another person._ Once per rest, a Glimmerling may concentrate and establish a connection to a consenting character and aid them in recovering memories for as long as the other chooses to keep the contact.  This is a purely roleplayed ability and may not be used to determine truth.  If attempting to use this ability to recall specific plot information, seek a plot member beforehand, so they can be on hand to describe what is witnessed.

*Trickster*: _Glimmerlings as a race, are very cunning and crafty and delight in causing the occasional confusion and chaos._ Once per day, a Glimmerling may recall to a pre-designated location ala the same rules as Rune of Recall and call, "Activate Recall, 1 I recall, 2 I recall, 3 I recall."  They must drop any items acquired prior to vanishing.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Physical representations of any unique characteristics should be done.

## Goblin

---  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ***  
RP     **  
```
**Physical Description**:

Goblins appear with green complexions, pointed ears, and long, pointed noses that may have large warts.  Most Goblins are bald, but it is common to see them in gaudy wigs.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 5 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 30 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  60 Years.

**Overview**:

Hailing from nearly all reaches of Evren, Goblins are descendants of a race once imbued with magic and connected to a protective and empowering being their shamans refer to as the All-Father.  While each tale will likely vary as to why they are no longer linked to any such creature, Goblins today do not look at this as some kind of loss, but rather that they are much stronger without the fetters of dependency.

Resourceful and clever, if not traditionally wise, Goblins are unreservedly proud of their achievements.  The scale or scope of the achievement rarely factors in, so long as, to their perception, something was completed in a way that brought them satisfaction.  Sharing such gratification with others, or worse, being forced to credit another for their accomplishment is not only demoralizing, but often treated as an affront and impugnment of their person.

In ages long since past, Goblins were subjugated and enslaved by Orcs on the heels of the Orcs themselves having gained their own freedom.  This lasted for about as long as it took Goblins to outsmart the Orcs, which is to say, not very long.  Still, a bitterness toward Orc-kind remains today in many Goblin communities.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Improvised Equipment*: _Exceptionally enterprising in a pinch, Goblins are innovative and quick-thinking individuals that are undaunted by a "broken" piece of equipment._  Once per rest, a Goblin may use a weapon, shield, or piece of armor that is broken until their next rest.  After this use, the item crumbles and may not be repaired or salvaged.

*Run Away*: _Being so incredibly clever sometimes has its pitfalls, and the sudden need to "get out of dodge" is a unique skill all Goblins seem to develop._  Once per day, a Goblin may elect to flee an encounter by yelling, "RUN AWAY!"  For 10 seconds, this Goblin may Dodge an unlimited number of times, but must be physically fleeing.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Achieving pointed ears that slope back or downward can be done by wearing Elf ears backwards.

## Halfling

---  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup **  
RP     *  
```
**Physical Description**:

Halflings have complexions that may range from fair to ebony, slightly pointed ears, and are often recognized by hair feet, hairy forearms, and long sideburns.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 30 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 90 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  150 Years.

**Overview**:

Typically rather practical, Halflings are community-oriented people that relish a good challenge or being presented with a new task to bend their considerable, natural intellect toward.  They are often viewed as rather industrious due to their advances in homestead technologies and it is not uncommon for a Halfling to be seen working on a city planning council or to be sought out as a consultant for a variety of tasks.

Most often, Halflings make their homes in multi-race towns and villages, though all-Halfling communities certainly exist and are likely one of the most functional, well-run places it is possible to encounter.

The values held by the majority of Halflings are the home, the belly, and the mind – in that order, of course.  Without a home, there is not a place in which to feed the belly.  If you cannot feed the belly, then you cannot aptly use the mind.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Make Myself At Home:* _Halflings are exceptionally light-fingered, and have little concept for such mundane things as "personal space."_ Once per Rest, a Halfling may spend 60 seconds of Roleplay to pick a single lock of any difficulty.

*Community Outreach*: _All Halflings have a strong sense of community, and may use that connection to provide protection to their friends and loved ones._ Once per Day, a Halfling may spend a minute of roleplay telling stories, singing a song, or sharing a meal, to deliver a single, "Voice Radius Magic Barrier" of a type of their choosing.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Sideburns and excess hair can appear on all Halflings and should be physically represented in some visible manner.

## Human

---  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup *  
RP     *  
```
**Physical Description**:

Humans may appear with complexions ranging from pale to ebony and may have varied markings or identifiers based on their region or culture.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 18 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 60 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  100 Years.

**Overview**:

Humans have been around Evren for as long as anyone can remember, and though their lifespan is not as lengthy as some races, they nevertheless make up for in the structures they establish, leave behind, reclaim, and rebuild.  They are a fairly common sight in nearly every region, as at some point, their natural inclination toward wanderlust will take over some individuals who strike out and begin yet another community somewhere new.

From their own perspectives, Humans are tenacious, steadfast, full of determination, and always striving toward greatness – though the exact definition of what greatness is will always vary.  Building villages into towns and cities, then establishing laws and governing entities are the main strengths of Humans and in their expert opinion, are things they do for the betterment of all races and helps establish fairness.

Outside opinions of Humans are perhaps not as gilded, as many other races would describe Humans as greedy, controlling creatures that wander about, declaring any open plot of ground their new property.  Expecting all others to follow any laws and regulations they set forth, and having the amazing gall to refer to themselves as the "normal-looking ones."  Not all opinions of Humans boil down to this perspective, of course.  There are plenty of people that happily coexist within Human towns that have become melting pots of mixed cultures and races.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Survivor*: _Humans are incredibly adaptable and able to survive when most others would not._ Once per rest, a Human may have a free usage of Endurance by spending 1 minute of concentration to prime the ability. While primed, if the character reaches 59 seconds of their Dying count, this ability triggers to return the target to 1 Body instead of becoming Dead, and the character must declare, "Endurance". This is an ENDURE effect. An individual cannot have more than one primed ENDURE effect at once.


## Kindred

---  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ****  
RP     **  
```
**Physical Description**:

Individuals appear with a variety of complexions, markings, and body parts.  They are recognized most commonly by appearing as a distinct humanoid-animal hybrid.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 30 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 150 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  250 Years.

**Overview**:

A fairly rare sight in Evren, the Kindred are the most diverse of the races in the sense that there are many different types, each appearing as an anthropomorphic form of another creature.  Being such wildly varied people, it should come as no surprise that their cultures, beliefs, appearances, and practices will all differ from one to another.  What the Kindred do share is the common trait of perseverance in the face of animosity.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Increased Metabolism*: _Kindred's physiology is impressively streamlined, allowing them sometimes shake off Toxins that might often incapacitate them._ Once per Rest a Kindred may reduce a 20 second Toxin Effect upon themselves to 3 seconds by incanting, "Minimize Toxin".

*Invoke Instinct*: _All Kindred possess a powerful connection to their primal pasts, and can invoke the prey instincts of a target._ Once per day, a Kindred may invoke the fear of the hunt in a target by incanting, "Aether Stop Thrust", preventing their target from advancing.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Facepaint and physical representations should be present and match the animal-type for the specific Kindred.

## Kobold

---  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ***  
RP     **  
```
**Physical Description**:

Kobolds appear as reptilian humanoids with red or blue scaled complexions, black nostrils, blackened eye sockets, and an elongated, flattened snout akin to caiman or crocodiles.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 3 years

**Median Life Expectancy**: 7 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  15 Years.

**Overview**:

Kobolds can typically be found living in small, roving clans or in rustic, out of the way settlements. From the outsider's perspective, Kobolds and their communities are grossly lacking in laws and rife with theft.  This extends to the belief that the primary interests of every Kobold fall to impulsively gathering up anything interesting or shiny that isn't nailed down hard enough to keep them from making off with it and with the thing it is nailed to.  That is to say, most people believe that to Kobolds, there are only two properties of ownership:  "mine and things I don't care about."

Bright-eyed and precocious, Kobolds are among the shortest lived races, with all the chaotic cleverness and volubility it takes to get by.  When it comes to their supposed kleptomania, the majority of Kobolds will vehemently dispute any such accusation.

Kobolds typically respect the notions of ownership and possession, for anything they have an emotional attachment to is something they consider theirs and they would go to great lengths to keep it that way.  For everything else, a Kobold is likely to tell anyone that possession is entropic.

The worth most Kobolds place on things has very little to do with its intrinsic value or utility and everything to do with whether or not the object has captured their attention and or imagination. Uniquely held concepts such as this persist among most Kobolds, often presenting views and ideas about the world around them and how it works with a perceived naivety or ingenuousness.

**Racial Abilities**:

*MY SHINY*: _Kobolds are distinctly aware of the entropic nature of having things and so will closely guard things that are of great importance to them – or things that are important to them today._  Once per rest, a Kobold may declare one item on their person as protected, preventing the item from being taken from them, even in death.  This status lasts only until the start of their next rest, when they may declare another thing.  If the protected item is a container, only the container is protected, nothing inside of it.

*Ooo, Shiny*: _Kobolds are well-known for their impulsive nature of taking things they believe are interesting or needed._  Once per day, a Kobold may scrounge up a random item.  This must be done with Plot.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  The particular shade or hue of blue or red is up to the player.  The eye sockets should be blacked out up to the eyebrows and may extend to create angular shapes.  The nostrils should be black and come to small triangular tips just above the nostril.  Physical representations for horns and tails are encouraged.

## Orc

---  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ***  
RP     **  
```
**Physical Description**:

Orcs appear with green complexions and are recognized by their protruding lower teeth.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 15 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 40 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  80 Years.

**Overview**:

Like the grassy streaks that never seem to quite wash out of that favorite pair of pants, a viridian stain of Orcish clans spread across the central lands of Evren.  Most of the other races steer clear of them, though it is not unheard of to find pockets of Goblins existing either among them or in villages situated somewhere an Orc claims as their territory.

The capital-D Dominance-based culture of these Orcs is more than just how their hierarchical society gets structured, it is a way of life that comes more naturally than breathing.  With this consideration, some other races may be confused at how Orc society has become matriarchal until one stops to consider that the needs and urges that feed into this culture are present within Orcs even as children, and who would they most likely challenge but their own caretakers?

The basis of this culture does not hinge much on codes of honor or only fighting "the right way."  To most Orcs, the way to establish Dominance is to do whatever it takes to still be standing and if that involves trickery and cunning, then that is exactly how they'll accomplish it.  After all, they learned all about the value of outsmarting their opponents from the Goblins they once subjugated.  But, Orcs do not exactly pride themselves on being smarter than their opponent, just being strong enough to make their opponent dumber by way of repeated blows to the head.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Rub Dirt In It*: _Orcs are strong and their beliefs are as strong, if not stronger.  In fact, an Orc's faith in their own toughness and ability allows them the firm certainty that cramming a wound full of dirt is a sure way to heal it – but only small wounds, and only sometimes._  Once per rest, an Orc may restore a dying character to 1 body.

*Last Stand*: _Like an Orc's faith in dirt's ability to heal, an Orc has an even truer faith in themselves to outlast even the limits of their bodies._  Once per day, an Orc may take their last stand and become immune to everything for 10 seconds.  After use, the Orc falls over dead and requires a Life/Revivify spell.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**:  Protruding lower teeth should be physically represented in addition to a green complexion.

## Unbound

---  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ***  
RP     ****  
```
**Physical Description**:

Unbound appear with complexions of blue, red, orange, brown, or grey with bright streaks, lines, or cracks of glowing power.  These lines typically appear as white or as more luminous colors of their complexions.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 20 Years.

**Median Life Expectancy**: 90 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  150 Years.

**Overview**:

When asked about their origins, most Unbound are unlikely to have an answer.  Those that do, will likely speak of an ancient tale about an event known as The Night of Madness.  Half a millennium ago, there existed a people called the Taitrel.  The Taitrel appeared quite similarly to Humans, yet with startlingly bright eyes in icy blues, fiery reds and oranges, stone greys, earthy browns, and electric yellows.

For the Taitrel people, The Night of Madness began with a chaotic wave of elemental force that washed across their lands, decimating their population and reducing their homes to rubble.  Those that survived this incident, found themselves to possess bodies with complexions in the very same colors they once attributed as simple eye colors.  Bright lines of power rippled across their newly colored forms line veins of pure, luminous, elemental power.  The Taitrel were no longer.  They had become something else – something more.  Something unbound.

Though scattered all about Evren, it did not take long for the refugees to find each other.  Faced with rampant xenophobia bred by the continent-spanning Godslayer Wars, the Unbound banded together and carved out small territories for themselves.  These small territories grew into factions, typically led by individuals with exceptional qualities that aligned with what is most valued by a particular faction.

The Unbound that may be found alone are typically those that have established themselves as civil-minded mediators and advisors among other races, despite their somewhat fearsome appearance.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Elemental Blood*: _The Unbound can tap into their elemental nature to either spend their vitality to attack others or they may absorb the elemental energies from an incoming attack, and be healed by it._ Once per rest, Unbound may spend X number of body to use as a packet delivered spell ("Spell X*2 &lt;Element>").  Alternatively, they may instead receive healing from an incoming attack of the character's chosen element.("Appears to Heal Me").

*Elemental Transmutation*: _The Unbound are amalgamations of elemental forces and living beings. As such they are able to tap into the makeup of matter._ Once per day, an Unbound may transmogrify a single component of any rank into a different, single component of the same rank.

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: To make glowing lines of power, it's suggested to use white paint and either line it with a thin black line or put a thin line of color through the middle of the white in order to create a colored line that appears to glow.  Facepaint aside from the glowing lines should match the elemental type of the character.  Ie:  Fire should be red or red-orange tones and hues, electricity should be grey, but may be blue, water should be blue, and stone should be earthy browns or rocky grey. 

## Unforgiven

---  
**Make up & Roleplay Expectation:**  
```
Makeup ***  
RP     ****  
```
**Physical Description**:

Unforgiven appear with a red complexion with smoky black shadowing, black horns that sprout from the skull or face, and a thin barbed tail.

**Average Age of Adulthood**: 20 Years

**Median Life Expectancy**: 90 Years.

**Maximum Lifespan**:  130 Years.

**Overview**:

Over half a millennium ago, during the Godslayer Wars, the Iblis people opened an inter-planar gate from their home to Evren, through which they staged an invasion of what is now known as the Khuurai Steppe and the region north of Lac Gronk.  Their appearance was more than enough to initially terrify most and for many years, they roamed the western lands, bringing battle to those that chose not to flee.

Their conquest was short-lived, however, as they lacked the organization to unite their territories in a lasting empire. Their relentless advance was eventually halted, then reversed as a series of brutal counter-attacks from their neighbors crippled the overextended invaders.  Too intensely pressured by the creatures they had initially thought of as little more than sport, the horned invaders fled back through their gate, hastily closing it.  Many of the Iblis were left stranded, forced to face the mercy of a world they had shattered.

Persecuted by the angry Evrens, the numbers of the unintentional refugees dwindled as more and more of them went into hiding and the Iblis became convinced of one thing:  they would never be forgiven by the people of Evren.  Generations passed and as the memories of these events faded into legend, so, too, did the stigma formerly attached to the name they had taken:  Unforgiven.

A rare sight today, the Unforgiven began appearing again and integrating themselves into other societies.  While some may be put off by their appearance and liken them to old stories of demons, they are generally accepted in mixed-race towns and cities.  In these scarce sightings, the Unforgiven will have typically become a distinguished individual of either exceptional skill or of singular intelligence and wit.

**Racial Abilities**:

*Call To Darkness*: Most Unforgiven today likely owe their very existence to their ancestors' cultivation of slipping away into their own shadow.  For some, this may seem like a trick of the eyes or that an Unforgiven has managed to hide away in plain sight; however, they remain very much visible, but for a short time, enjoy the safety the darkness grants them.  The aptitude for managing such a feat remains prevalent even into modern times.  Once per rest, an Unforgiven may spend 5 seconds in Concentration in order to slip into their own shadow and take the INVULNERABLE effect for 1 minute.  Within their own shadow, an Unforgiven is unable to move, communicate with others, nor use items or skills.  The Unforgiven is immune to all game effects, except SOLIDIFY and Dispel Magic.

*Harvest Essence*:  _Unforgiven have a stronger connection to the spiritual essence of other creatures than most, and use that connection to help them collect Spirit Gems._  Once per day, an Unforgiven may deliver a single, "Magic Entrap Spirit".

**Makeup Suggestions and Guidelines**: Horn sizes and placements may vary at player discretion, but should be black or dark in color.  Some Unforgiven players choose to "hide" their barbed tail, but otherwise this should also be physically represented.

## Effect Clarifications

---

### Concentration
Concentration consists of being silent, not using skills or items, not running, and typically maintaining physical contact with something. Rest refers to a period of time in which a player does not use abilities or run.  This is done to reset expended abilities or skills.  More information about rest can be found in the Resting section.

### Counts for Abilities or Skills
Your feet must be planted during any n-count, unless the ability or effect explicitly states that the character is able to walk.  This does not apply to Concentration abilities.  See Concentration.
Example:  Rapid Refit is an ability that requires a 5 second count, during which a character may not walk.  Tap Reserves is an ability that requires 1 minute of Concentration, during which a character may walk.

### Critical Ability
A character invoking a Critical ability is able to use the specified ability against a single target of their choice. They may continue to use the ability against that target until either the character completes a Rest, or the character invokes another Critical ability (against the same or another target).

### Curse of Transformation
* Curse of Transformation (CoT) makes the target immune to CoT, meaning the effect does not stack.
* Any character or NPC created by CoT is not capable of inflicting CoT on another character. The only time this is not true is for very specific and limited plot reasons.
* There are three types of CoT: Ones that go away on death, ones that go away on resurrection, and ones that go away only with ritual. All COTs may be removed by ritual.
 * If the character is CoT into a skeleton (think like a Greater version of Create Undead), that'll probably go away on death.
 * If the character is CoT into a Vampire, that might go away on Resurrection.
 * If the character is CoT into a Plot device, that might require a ritual.

### Entrapment Clarification
The Entrapment spell allows a caster the chance to capture the spirit of a target. Entrapment works on ANY creature that matches the following:
* Must have human-like intelligence.
* Must be alive.
* Must have a spirit that is **NOT** protected by a SPIRIT BOTTLE effect.
* Must not crumble at 0 body.

### Shattering & Destroying
Shattering or destroying containers that contain things does NOT affect the items within it.

### Skill-less Clarification
Skill-less refers to any abilities purchased with Skill Points. A character does not lose any armor or body gained from purchased skills.

**Physical description characteristics of Curse of Transformations and Transforms are not always uniquely identifiable, and cannot be used to reliably ascertain the presence of a Curse of Transformation.
For instance,  there are many creatures that have fangs, so a "fanged humanoid" is not necessarily a vampire

***Enslavement can be identified by using a Break Enslavement Rune.

# Skillsets

---
## Skillset Prioritization
Chronicles uses a classless skill system where players may choose primary and secondary skillsets for their character.  The skillsets not chosen as a primary or secondary will become the character's tertiary.  Choosing these skillsets will adjust the skill point costs of the skills within each skillset.  The available skillsets are named thematically for their related skills, which can give the average player a general idea of what they modify.

### Arcane Skillset
The Arcane skillset enables a character to delve into Arcane magic and cast Arcane spells.

### Fighter Skillset
This skillset has a higher focus on the skills most related to fighting.  It has reduced costs for skills like weapon proficiencies, armor, shield, and stamina.

### Nature Skillset
The Nature skillset enables a character to delve into Nature magic and cast Nature spells.

### Spirit Skillset
The Spirit skillset enables a character to delve into Nature magic and cast Spirit spells.

### Rogue Skillset
This skillset has a higher focus on the skills most related to subterfuge and utility.  It has reduced costs for skills such ass agility, lockpicking, trapping, and escaping.

### Thaumaturgy Skillset

### General Skillset
This skillset encompasses skills that have a general availability.  There are no cost adjustments for the skills in this skillset.  This skillset cannot be chosen as a primary, secondary, or tertiary skillset.

For each purchase of this skill, the character gains +3 damage that can be allocated as chosen between front and back damage. The total of the damage allocated to only backstabbing must be equal to or greater than double the damage allocated to the front, and at least 1 point must be allocated to the front. Ie, no more than 1/3rd of the damage points can be allocated to the front. Put another way, the front damage cannot exceed the number of Backstabs purchased. This skill grants the character the ability to use one-handed melee weapons, and this skill may only be applied to one-handed melee weapons. The bonus damage from Backstab and One-Handed Weapon Proficiency may never be combined. A character cannot purchase both the One-handed Melee Proficiency skill and the Backstab skill. To use the damage from behind, the player must be physically behind the target and able to see both of the target's shoulder blades.<br><br>Example:<br>Reynold the Rogue purchases 10 Backstabs. He may allocate his +30 damage points in any of these ways: +10 front /+20 back, +5 front /+25 back, +1 front/+29 back.

## Escape Artist  
This skill is purchased multiple times. Each time this skill is purchased, the character may escape from magical, or non-magical bindings by completing a 3 second count of escaping the bonds. "1 I escape binding...2 I escape binding…" This skill is refreshed each Rest.

## Lockpicking  
This skill is purchased multiple times. Each skill rank indicates the proficiency of the character in picking locks. To pick a lock, the character must provide their own draw bag and several beads in each of four colors. One color represents success (one bead). One color represents breaking the lock (one bead). One color represents that the character can continue the attempt (several beads), And one color represents resetting the bag (several beads). The base bag has 1 success, 1 break, 4 continue, 1 reset. The character's skill rank is compared to the tier of the lock. For each rank that the character's skill is under the lock, add 2 continue and 1 reset. If the character's skill is equal to, or above the lock there is no change to the bag. The character may draw from the bag every 30 seconds until success, or the lock is broken.

## Mimicry  
This skill allows the character to use any single Spell or Stamina ability once per purchase of Mimicry.  The character must additionally expend a number of Agility Points equal to double the mimicked ability's Mana or Stamina cost, as appropriate.  Mimicry cannot be used on level 10 Spells.  Use requires the verbal:  My turn!  <ability verbal/incant>

## Trapping  
This skill is purchased once. Trapping allows the character the chance to set a trap using the in-game trap tag, trap physical representation, and trap trigger. Setting a trap takes as long as it actually takes to set the trap. Trapping also allows the character to attempt to disarm a set trap using out of game and in-game tools. The character must actually disarm the trigger of the trap, and do so without destroying the trigger. Most disarmed traps can be saved for later use.
# Thaumaturgy Skillset

---
| Skill | Primary | Secondary | Tertiary |
|---|---|---|---|
|Attunement: Thaumaturgy|16+4|||
|Last Rites|0|||
|Dredge|10|||

## Attunement: Thaumaturgy  
Increases the character's Thaumaturgy Mana Pool by 10 points. A character may NOT purchase Attunement: Thaumaturgy if they have any other Attunement skill. Only characters with Thaumaturgy as their Primary Skillset may purchase Attunement: Thaumaturgy; it cannot be a Secondary or Tertiary skill. Thaumaturges cannot use memorization and are ineligible for the bonus Mana Points associated with it (they may still use memorization for any Stamina or Agility pools they have, if they choose).<br><br>Thaumaturgy does not grant access to a school of spells like other Attunement skills do for their respective spell lists. Instead, each Rest, Thaumaturges may, for each spell level below 10, choose 2 spells from different schools of magic to be able to cast that day. These are the only spells on which the character may expend Mana Points. If the Thaumaturge has purchased the Specialization skill for one of Arcane, Nature, or Spirit, then they are also able to cast all of the 10th level spells in that school.

## Last Rites  
This allows a character to perform a short ritual on a recently-dead corpse to replenish their mana. Upon completion, the character's current Thaumaturgy Mana Points are increased by 5. This does not allow a character to increase their current Mana Points above their maximum Mana Point cap.<br><br>The target of this ability must be a creature that had a metabolism, is currently in its Death count, is not Reviving, cannot seek resurrection <i>(ie, not a PC)</i>, and was physically repped by a player <i>(situational exceptions may be granted only by Plot)</i>. Note: Similar to Entrap Spirit, this ability may be used on the corpse of an NPC that did not wait to be searched, Entrapped, or given Last Rites. Under these circumstances, the player <b><i>must</b></i> inform the mod marshal that they intend to use this ability on the mod or immediately after its use.<br><br>Performing the Last Rites ability requires the in game verbal, 'Last Rites' and then a thematically appropriate couplet of the character's choice. All verbals must be approved by the Head of Plot, recorded and signed off on the player's character sheet.<br><br>Ex:<br>"A strengthened pounding in my chest, as I now lay you to rest."

"Your mana drank adds to my power, now my enemies quake and cower."

"By sword and spell you have been slain, leave only body and blood stains."

## Dredge  
This skill replaces the Last Rites ability. Dredge allows a Thaumaturge access to the spells Control Minor Undead, Entrap Spirit, Vampiric Touch, Create Undead, and Enervate, without needing to allocate them to one of their 2 spells/level.<br><br>Game Lore Note: Dredging a corpse is a form of necromancy and is illegal in most kingdoms. It carries a social stigma in nearly all cultures; it is perceived as a desecration and is regarded as disrespectful, vile, unclean, a perversion, <i>etc.</i>.

# Ritual Magic


## About Ritual Magic

---
Ritual Magic is the way through which an individual attempts to weave the powers of themselves or greater beings to affect incredible and often long-lasting effects upon the world. A ritualist is someone who is trained in these magics and in the art of channeling them to achieve their desired goals. Purchasing the Ritual Magic Skill enables the character to perform rituals.

A ritual is the act through which a ritualist attempts to conduct these magics, and each ritualist's method for enacting a ritual is different, though there are a few generally agreed upon elements that must be achieved in order for a ritual to succeed. Firstly, a ritual must last at least 5 minutes in order for success to be achieved. It has been said that in times of great need a ritualist can attempt to end the ritual earlier than this, but they risk failure at best, horrible backlash at worst. Secondly, a ritual must contain a persistent visual or auditory element. Some ritualists chant, sing, or recite scripture of their Deity. Others may choose to draw or cast runes, dance, or create art as a focus for their magic. All that matters is that these elements are consistent throughout the ritual, without long lapses or interruptions. Third, the ritualist must provide a source of power other than their own for the ritual, often in the form of Spirit Gems, a number of which must be provided equal to the level of the ritual. Lastly, and most importantly, the ritualist must have the ritual scroll open and accessible to them at all times during the ritual, even if they do not need to actively gaze upon it. If the ritual scroll is not present, or if during the ritual it is removed or hidden from the ritualist, the ritual will fail. These four elements are commonly referred to as the "fundamental four elements" of rituals, without which a ritual is all but doomed to failure.

There are other ways through which a ritualist may enhance their casting and thus the odds of success. A few of the more commonly accepted methods are as follows. First, the inclusion of further ritual props, themed appropriately for the ritual being attempted, though some rituals may require specific props to be present to even be cast at all. Secondary ritualists who can aid in the focusing and channeling of the magic, and even non-ritualists whose nature or actions are particularly in-tune with the desired outcome of the ritual may aid in its success. Some ritualists opine that at their core, rituals are a performance for the gods, and as such, the more devoted the casters are to providing a grand spectacle, the more likely the gods are to look upon their attempts with favor and grant their desires. Conversely, if the participants in the ritual are clearly out of sync, under prepared, or otherwise break the flow of the ritual, the Gods are more likely to punish the attempt.

There exists for ritualists a "standard library" of rituals, of which all ritualists have access to at all times, as they are capable of producing a new scroll for these rituals from memory. Rituals outside of this library must be acquired through diligent research or through discovery in the world at large. scrolls for rituals outside the standard library may have the potential to be memorized or even taught, with each scroll indicating how many times, if at all, it may be memorized, and subsequently if it can be taught and how often. Once memorized, a scroll is considered part of that ritualist's standard library. If a ritual is not part of the ritualist's standard library, they must have the exact scroll to perform the ritual, and this must be shown to Plot before the ritual can begin. If a ritualist wishes to memorize a scroll, they must do so by showing the scroll to Plot, so Plot can note their character sheet and the scroll appropriately. For any ritual in the standard library, a ritualist must still have a scroll representation during the ritual, following all normal rules, they simply do not need the tagged scroll item.

For base standard library (not memorized) rituals, only the fundamental four elements need to be achieved in order to guarantee success. For all others, it is recommended that further aspects be added, as with each increase in a ritual's level, the odds of success decrease. It is claimed that a ritualist who attempts to cast a ritual using only the fundamental four elements, they have at best a 60% chance of success. Use of props, secondary casters, or other participants can help increase these odds. Similarly, poor performance, inappropriate props or participants, or disjointed or disharmonic casting may decrease the odds of success, and invite potential backlash.

A ritual has 4 possible outcomes:
* Success - This indicates that the ritual has succeeded as intended, and the desired effect has been achieved without further incident.
* Flaw - This means that the ritual has completed, but often with a side effect of some kind, with varying degrees of severity.
* Failure - This indicates that the ritual failed, with no further effects, but any spirit gems or other consumable materials used in the ritual are still consumed.
* Backlash - This indicates that the ritual not only failed, but a severe negative effect has occurred, up to and including death of the caster or participants.  Any spirit gems or materials are still consumed.

Following are the standard library, and other rituals for which the scroll must be discovered or re-invented.

## Standard Library

---
### Ritual Level I

#### Elemental Shift
This ritual augments "Mana Bolt" for an arcane magic character at every level with one of either:
 * Flame Bolt - "I conjure a flame bolt &lt;number>."
 * Frost Bolt - "I conjure a frost bolt &lt;number>."
 * Shock Bolt - "I conjure a shock bolt &lt;number>."
 * Stone Bolt - "I conjure a stone bolt &lt;number>."

The target of this ritual chooses the element at the end of the ritual casting. This change is permanent until this ritual is once again cast on the target at which time a different element may be selected. This ritual requires that the ritualist use a physical representation for each of the four elements: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth.

#### Create Spirit Familiar
This ritual siphons off a portion of the character's spirit, creating the physical form of a spirit familiar. The form of the spirit familiar is left up to the player with the final approval of the plot team. Once the ritual is complete, the spirit familiar will take shape and be with the character at all times. The spirit familiar is visible to everyone, is not recognizable as a spirit familiar, but can be identified as one.  Spirit familiars cannot be affected by any form of attack and cannot be used as a shield.  This ritual requires that the target character have a pre-approved physical representation of their spirit familiar with them in the ritual.

### Ritual Level II

#### Dampen Magic
The caster attempts to extend their will to create an area that prevents the use of or casting of ritual magic - except for Destroy Ritual Magic.  If successful, the area will have a radius of 100ft that persists for 1 hour.  May only be destroyed by a Destroy Ritual Magic ritual.

### Ritual Level III

#### Race Change
The caster specifies a target to reshape into the race chosen by the caster. If the ritual succeeds, the target is changed to the targeted race and gains the racial traits of the selected race, whilst losing those of the previous race.

#### Purify/Corrupt The Land
The caster reaches out to the surrounding environment and attempts to either restore it to its natural state or corrupt it into an inherently damaging state.

### Ritual Level IV

#### Spirit Journey
 This ritual allows the target to seek out information or ask a question of the spirit realm. They will experience a vision quest related to that topic. The source of the vision may be their own subconsciousness, tribal ancestors, spirit guides, or other metaphysical sources as appropriate for the performance of the ritual. The events of the journey are not guaranteed to be truthful; The spirits may be fickle, capricious, or even simply out of touch with the physical reality of Evren. 

#### Spirit Link
This ritual allows an individual to bond with an item. The ritual is cast upon the item. Bonding with an item requires completing a full Rest with possession of the item, which will link the item to the person who rested with it and break any other links the item may have had. The spirit linked item may be passed off to another individual if both individuals complete a rest together.  Other than via changing the bond with a Rest, the spirit linked item cannot be removed from the individual and will stay with the individual even through death and resurrection.
    
#### Spirit Lock
This ritual forms a permanent bond between a specific item and a target individual. This bond transcends the physical realm, ensuring that no matter where the individual may go, the item will always follow. As long as the item endures, it is locked to the target, unable to be stolen, given away, or even used by another individual. If the target should die and their spirit departs to seek resurrection, the item will follow them. This does not grant any extra resilience for the item, and the effect will fade if the item is destroyed or expires. If the individual somehow becomes incapable of possessing the item (ex: permanent death), the item is destroyed immediately.

#### Magical Barrier
This ritual is designed to imbue the participants with additional magical shielding. Each target that actively participates in the casting of the ritual gains a single use of Resist Magic that lasts for one day or until used. This defensive is subject to an available Defensive Slot.

### Ritual Level V

#### Spirit Forge
The caster reaches into the very essence of the target and gives the target a glimpse into the infinite multitude of possibilities posed by their history and growth. This spell allows the target to instantly choose to change their chosen skillsets and re-assign all assigned Skill Points they possess.

### Ritual Level VI

#### ?

### Ritual Level VIII

#### Destroy Ritual Magic
The caster attempts to focus their mastery of ritual magic in order to destroy any ritual magic effect. The difficulty of this spell is variable based on the level of the effect the caster is attempting to destroy. It is highly recommended that anyone undertaking this ritual prepare thoroughly and do everything in their power to boost their chance of success, as any magic that might require such an intervention is likely to prove difficult to destroy.

### Ritual Level IX

##### ?

### Ritual Level X

#### Empower Spirit
The ritualist empowers a character with grand energies of might and magic. This ritual channels the energies of the consumed spirit gems directly into the target character, granting them incredible resilience to face an upcoming challenge. The target gains 2x Resist Physical and 2x Resist Spell, and an intangible suit of 50 armor that cannot be refit by any means, but stacks over any worn armor and bypasses normal armor caps. These last for 1 day, until expended, or the target resurrects. A character may be empowered in this way no more than once per week.

# Resting

## Resetting Skills and Magic Items

---
Adventurers are powerful individuals who rely on magic and skill to defeat their enemies. This expenditure of endurance both physically and magically takes a toll on even the most mighty of heroes on Evren. Even the most powerful of artifacts requires time to recharge its stores. 

There are two ways skills and magic items can be recharged and used again:  Rest or Per Day.

## Rest
Rest is a short period of time to recuperate and regain expended skills and abilities. Upon the completion of a Rest, a character's ability pools will be reset to full, and any per-Rest abilities are renewed and able to be used again.

Resting takes 10 minutes. Using any game skills, running, losing health, dying, or otherwise engaging in strenuous activity will interrupt the Rest, and require it to be restarted. A character may not initiate a Rest within two hours of the completion of a previous Rest. A player may also choose to NPC during their character's Rest Time for more game rewards!
 
The player must record the time of their Rest on their battleboard or character sheet, and must inform a Logistics Marshal as soon as is convenient.

When a player checks in, they will be issued a labeled battleboard. Logistics will also label additional battleboards with the player and character's name, and these will be kept in a file folder at logistics. When the player wants to Rest, they'll need to head to logistics to swap out their old battleboard for their next one.

The file folders will be accessible by players in such a way that, if a logistics marshal isn't present at that time, the player can still exchange their battleboards. The player is still responsible for informing the logistics marshal at their earliest convenience, or leave a note with their name and the time they swapped out their battleboards at the logistics station.

During an event, a character may Rest a number of times equal to twice the number of the game days in the event, minus one.  

> Example:
> A character may Rest up to 3 times during a 2-day event (aka, the most common and typical Chronicles event).
> For a 3-day event (such as Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends), a character may Rest up to 5 times.

## Per Day

---
Magic items, production skills, and some effects recharge or expire at the end of the day. This time occurs at 6pm (out of game) each day. This happens automatically and is not considered a Rest period.

# Inventory: Coins, Tags, and Loot

## Looting
A player may approach a fallen NPC and say, "I search you." If the monster has any loot to give, it will provide it. NPCs may also drop loot on the ground. If you find a coin, or tag on the ground, feel free to pick it up. (Be aware that looting other player's kills may be seen unfavorably especially if you're not contributing to combat. This is a reasonable arrangement to ask another player about in character.)
## Loot
Loot comes in a few shapes, the most common being money, tags, and reps. Coins are imprinted metal slugs only of value to this game, or cast resin shapes. Tags are business cards with print on them. Reps are physical representations of things in the game world-- these vary widely as they are often devices to ongoing plots, but can also just be as they are presented.
## Loot Splits
Loot splits, or treasure splits are considered an Out Of Game action.  Treasure splits for groups are performed by a Treasure Split Ambassador, which may be someone appointed by plot, someone on plot, or someone designated by the group.  For town mods, which are mods that the entire town or the majority of all event attendees participates in.  The treasure split for these mods includes all player attendees, including any that were not physically present on the mod or were NPCing for the mod.  In the event that a player is unable to collect their split will be taken back to logistics and labeled with the player's name.  Any gold will be credited to their character's bank and any tags will be made available for the player to pick up at their next event.
## Money
Money comes in two forms in Evren. A golden coin minted by the kingdom, or as a naturally occurring impure crystalline mana. Mana Crystals have resin cast phys reps. Players are free to exchange coins in whatever fashion they wish and game events can cause the "market" to fluctuate. The value of items is determined by denizens of the world (this includes you).
## Tags
Tags are the inventory items of Evren. These are functionally the items they say they are. A potion tag is effectively the bottle and its contents, though players are free to represent those items to encourage aesthetics and roleplay. If you use an item, be prepared for staff to ask that you present the tag for it as possession of the tag is possession of the item. Any extra info about the item apparent to you should be presented on the tag (ie. Incants for use, durability, effect, tier value, number of uses, etc.). In the case of armor and weapons, it falls to the player to rep the item, and more information on specifications can be found in the Equipment Section.
## Durability
Some items have limited uses. This is represented by a durability rating. If you anticipate you're going to use an item with durability over the market faire be sure to get it stamped during check-in by staff to track its durability.

## Additional Defense Slot  
This skill grants an additional Defense Slot which may be used to activate additional defenses.  A character may only have as many Active Defenses as they have Defensive Slots.  Any skill, ability, or effect that grants a Resist or Dodge requires a Defensive Slot to be prepared.  This includes Transforms.  All characters automatically have 1 Defense Slot for free and additional slots may be purchased with Skill Points.

## Dexterity Armor  
This skill adds 5 points of Dexterity Armor to the character for each purchase of the skill. Dexterity armor does not require a physrep.  Dexterity armor does not stack with any other source of armor.  This armor exists independently of and does not interact with the character's Armor Cap, and does not require the Armor Training skill. Refitting Dexterity Armor requires 1 minute of concentration, during which player must roleplay stretching, yoga, shadowboxing, etc..

## First Aid  
First Aid allows the character to provide emergency aid to a dying character. The character using First Aid will touch the downed character and say "Performing First Aid". While First Aid is being applied, the dying count of the targeted character stops. First Aid takes a base time of 1 minute to apply.  The character rendering First Aid is under concentration while providing the First Aid. Once the 1 minute is complete for First Aid, the downed character's body is restored to 1.

## Identify  
Identify allows a character to spend 1 minute concentrating while maintaining contact with a person or items to determine what, if any, magical properties the target has.

## Parrying Dagger  
This skill allows the character to wield a parrying dagger used to block attacks.   The parrying dagger may never be used for striking in combat. As long as the character is wielding the parrying dagger in one hand, any physical type attack that comes into contact with the parrying dagger is considered effectively blocked. The parrying dagger meet safety requirements of any other weapon.  The parrying dagger must be between 12"-18" in length, the handle is a maximum of 6", and the tips of the weapon must be red for easy identification.

## Ritual Magic  
This skill allows the character to access the standard ritual magic library.  More information can be found in the Ritual Magic section.

## Specialization  
When purchased, the character must specify which skillset they have mastery over. This skill allows that character to access level 10 abilities or spells.  This skill may be purchased only once.

## Spell Strike  
All characters choose between being able to packet-deliver their spells, or spellstrike their spells. This choice cannot be changed during an event.

## Tap Reserves  
All characters have the ability to summon reserve energy when necessary. Tap Reserves allows a character to spend 1 minute in concentration to set the ability pool associated with their Primary skillset to 5 points. This requires the character to have a maximum of at least 5 points in their primary skillset ability pool. (A Fighter primary character can set their Stamina Points to 5, a Rogue primary character can set their Agility Points to 5, and a Mage primary character can set their Mana Points to 5.) Note: This does NOT increasse their current pool points by 5, it sets the pool to 5 points. If the character had greater than 5 points in their pool prior to using Tap Reserves, they would be effectively losing points in that pool.) A character may never be compelled to use this ability by any means, it is always the choice of the player to use Tap Reserves.

## Tracking  
This skill is purchased once. Using this skill, the character can attempt to track a target's tracks. The target tracks are assigned a value according to weather, ground, recency, and skill of the target hiding their tracks. With all that taken in, the resulting modified track number is compared to the trackers number. Tracking can be combined with the survivalist knowledge skill to gain greater bonuses and be considered master tracker. When a player asks to track something/someone a marshal will determine if the tracking succeeds and how much information a player gets.  PCs cannot track other PCs.

## Foraging  
This skill is the is used to gather the materials for the Alchemy Skill. Foraging represents the character collecting herbs, reagents, or catalysts for use with the Alchemy skill.

## Logging  
This skill is the is used to gather the materials for the Rune Carving Skill. Logging represents the character collecting pieces of wood for use with the Rune Carving skill.

## Mining  
This skill is the is used to gather the materials for the Smithing Skill. Mining represents the character collecting raw ore for use with the Smithing skill.

## Alchemy  
This skill allows the character to alchemy carving items of a tier equal to the number of ranks purchased.

## Rune Carving  
This skill allows the character to craft rune carving items of a tier equal to the number of ranks purchased.

## Smithing  
This skill allows the character to craft smithing items of a tier equal to the number of ranks purchased.

## Artificing  
This skill allows the character to craft advanced magical items from a standard library of recipes.  This skill requires the character to have 5 ranks in every crafting skill (Alchemy, Smithing, Rune Carving).

## Recycling  
The Recycling skill allows the character to reclaim some of the raw materials used to craft an item that has been reduced to 0 Durability, been destroyed, or is an item no longer desired.  Items that are in use or activated may not be recycled.  Recycling returns 1/3rd of the materials used to construct it, rounded down to a minimum of one. These materials can either be claimed for future use or utilized immediately in the construction of a new item. This may not be used on consumable items.

| Stun Toxin     | 8               | 9            | 10             |

>Alchemy is capable of creating a variety of Ingestible Toxins. Each type in turn is capable of being turned into a Weapon Coating, a Dart for Throwing, or a Trap. Above is an easy reference table to show the tier at which a specific Toxin can be made in each of its forms. As a rule of thumb, the base Tier of an item +1 is a Coating, +2 for a Dart or Trap.

### Weapon Coatings
>Weapon coatings are single-use alchemical products that may be applied to weapons. To apply a coating, the character must have the coating in hand and roleplay pouring or rubbing the coating on the weapon for a 5-second count. Only the character who had possession of the weapon when the coating was applied may use that coating.
>
>For example, Alice applies a Sleep Coating to her long sword then hands the sword to Bob. Bob cannot use that coating.
>
>However, if Charlie presents his sword to Diane, who then applies a Sleep Coating to Charlie's sword, then Charlie (and only Charlie) may use that Sleep Coating.
>
>Once applied, the coating will last until it is used or the wielder rests, whichever comes first.
> 
### Toxin Darts
> Toxin Darts function similarly to their Ingestible Counterparts, except they have been processed into an aerosolized gas instead of a powder that must be consumed to take effect. When using a Toxin Dart, the character must throw a packet while declaring "Toxin (Effect)" of the type indicated on the item tag. This cannot be blocked by weapons or shields, much like a Spell Packet.
> 
### Traps
> Traps are pre-placed objects designed to deliver an effect to a small area when their trigger is set off. Trap Reps must be a minimum of 12"x6"x6", to a maximum of 36" in any dimension, and all Trap designs must be approved by a Rules Marshal prior to use. 
> 
> Setting a trap requires a minimum of 1 minute, but the trap is not active until the trigger has been fully set.
> 
> All traps must have a real, physical trigger that is attached to the trap. Setting off the trap must produce a noise or light that is detectable by an impartial observer. It must always be possible to see how to disarm a trap, although it may require light and a small mirror.
> 
> When Toxin traps are activated, it delivers the effects of the Toxin, centered on the trap as "Voice Radius Toxin [Effect]", at a casual speaking volume, such that someone 10 feet away could hear.

The sender must have met the intended recipient or have concrete knowledge of the person's existence, and recipients can choose to refuse any message, which will cause the message to fail to no effect.

   >This potent elixir has been specially mixed with materials, that when brewed correctly are capable of drawing ambient Aether from the air and infusing it into the imbiber, restoring their resource pool. At time of creation, Mana, Stamina, or Agility is chosen. This will create an item tag for Elixir of Mana, Elixir of Stamina, or Elixir of Agility. Upon consumption, which takes a three count, the drinker restores 5 points to the chosen resource pool. This cannot be used to bring the character's resource pool above their maximum.
#### Elixir of Invulnerability
> This incredible feat of Alchemical creation, this golden elixir represents the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Upon imbibing, which takes a three count, the drinker is made INVULNERABLE for 20 seconds. However, the overwhelming power of the elixir renders them incapable of doing much else. For the duration, the drinker cannot speak, use any in-game skills, may not run, and must keep both hands linked with arms pointed down towards their feet. After the effect ends, the drinker may not benefit from another Elixir of Invulnerability until they complete a rest. This Elixir does not provide any protection from Aether abilities. This item is consumed on use.
#### Elixir of Venom Spitting
> This strange elixir was created to mimic the abilities of foul monstrosities who can spit toxins like rain upon their enemies. The next time the drinker would suffer from a Toxin, they instead declare "Resist Absorb", and the drinker can then throw 5 instances of "Activate Toxin <Effect>" with no longer than 3 seconds between each throw, otherwise the effect ends. At the end of this period, the Elixir of Venom Spitting fades, and they may not benefit from an Elixir of Venom Spitting until they complete a rest. If the defense is not used prior to resting, the defense is lost. This takes a defense slot. This item is consumed on use.

This lock indicates that all portals are locked. The tag for the lock will be attached to the back of the lock presentation, and will note the quality of the lock as well as the lock ID code. To be able to enter a locked structure, a character must have a key tag that is ID associated with the lock. A character with a key may unlock a locked door on a 3 count, and may re-lock it on another 3 count. The rating of this lock is 1. This has 5 Durability.
#### Parrying Dagger

#### Whetstone 
   >A character can spend 1 minute of careful sharpening using this tool to improve a single weapon's base damage by 1 for 5 days.

This item does not work on Unarmed or Claws. This item is consumed on use.

The player slips the clip onto the pouch, or pocket, and goes to notify a Game Marshal. The Game Marshal will approach the picked character and retrieve one random game item from the picked character. If there is nothing in the picked pouch, then the larceny has resulted in no reward. The transfer of goods from Game Marshal to thief takes place out of sight from other players.  Tools have 10 charges.

### Tier VIII

#### Expandable Weapon
> A marvel of intricate crafting, this weapon modification is designed to allow the wielder the ultimate flexibility in controlling their reach.

This allows the wielder to use this item with a Short, Long, or Two-Handed weapon rep interchangeably. This cannot be applied to Unarmed or Claws.
#### Recycling Kit
> This kit is designed to assist in helping a Recycler be more efficient with their reclamation of materials. When a kit is made, a single Crafting Type is chosen from Alchemy, Smithing or Rune Carving. When the character recycles an item from that type, they may expend a charge from this kit to recover 1/2 of the ranks in materials used to construct it, rounded down to a minimum of one, instead of the usual 1/3. In the case of Recycling an Artificing item, the character only benefits from this increase for the materials of the chosen type, though multiple kits may be used in tandem. Ex: If an item required all three material types, and you use an Alchemy Recycling Kit and a Smithing Recycling Kit, you'd get 1/2 of those materials, but only 1/3 of the Rune Carving materials. This item has 3 charges.
#### Trickle Blade Modification

An Item with 2 or less Durability cannot benefit from this effect. This item is consumed on use.
#### Risky Smithing
   >Daring to push the boundaries of their craft, this technique is reserved for those with more skill than sense. By pushing their skill to the limit, this technique can grant a weapon, shield or armor of any quality an Enchantment slot. This will give a slot to a non-Masterwork item, or increase the maximum for a Masterwork item by one. However, this does not come without cost, and cuts the item's maximum durability in half, rounded down. This can be applied to the same item multiple times, but if it would reduce the durability to 0, or below the item's remaining durability, the item is destroyed. This cannot be applied to Destroyed items.

# Artificing

## Artificing
>Artificing is the study of the creation of magic items. Only those with at least a moderate command of each base craft can take the path of an Artificer. The creation of a magic item will vary wildly in its needs based on the item. Magic items always require materials from multiple disciplines. They also require spirit gems for the infusion of their impressive powers. All Artificers have access to a few base recipes that they may craft at will. Other items will require the development or acquisition of a Formula in order to be created. Formulas may also potentially be memorized, or even taught to others, depending on the Formula. Artificing requires 5 ranks in each production type.

## Attuning Enchanted Items
For a character to be able to utilize the effects of an enchanted or magical item, they must first attune that item.

Attuning requires the player to complete an entire rest while possessing an item, or come into game with the item attuned.  A character may attune multiple items at a time, however, an item may be attuned to only one character at a time.  The magic properties and enchantments of an item may only be used by a character that has attuned the item. 

Certain enchantments **do not** require attuning to be used:
* Elemental Aura
* Sticky Handle
* Destruction Magnet
* Magic Aura
* Sure Striking
* Elemental Resilience
* Omni-Elemental Aura
* Blade of Beginner's Luck
* Staunching Enchantment

> Example:  
> A character picks up a sword with a Magic Aura enchantment. The character will still swing the Magic damage type despite having not attuned the sowrd.  

> Example:  
> A character picks up a shield with a Manaward Enchantment, and does not attune it. They may use the shield as a standard shield to block weapon attacks (assuming they meet all other requirements for doing so), but may not utilize the Manaward Enchantment.


## Artificing Products

>Artificers, like regular crafters, utilize recipes for their creations, though the recipe for a magic item is known as a Formula. All Artificers have access to a Standard Library of Formulas, which they may utilize at any time, given they have the appropriate materials to construct the desired item. Other items are known to exist, which are known as "Uncommon Formulas", and Artificers may even attempt to invent their own, but these Formulas must first be created or discovered to utilize new and different items.

>A Magic Item will generally require the following for materials in order to be crafted. A number of materials of various kinds, with a total in material ranks equal to 10 times the Tier of the Magic Item, number of Spirit Gems equal to the Tier of the Item. All Magic Items have a 10 Durability.

>Uncommon Formulas may sometimes be Memorized or even Taught by Artificers. Formulas discovered in the world will have a notation on them indicating if they can be Memorized, and if so, how many times before the Formula is no longer functional. They may also have a notation for how many times a Formula may be Taught after being Memorized, if it may be Memorized at all. If an Uncommon Formula is not capable of being Memorized, or the Artificer does not wish to Memorize it, then when attempting to create the item the Formula must be shown to Logistics before the item tag will be produced.

>Presented here are the Standard Library of Items, as well as any items known to the world at large as "Uncommon Formulas", for which the Formula may be discovered or re-invented,

# Knowledge Skills

>Knowledge skills are a way through which characters can gather information about the world around them. These skills are gained automatically as a character gains SP, choosing a Profession and Hobby, with their Profession being your "main focus" and scaling faster. Once they have capped a Profession or Hobby at Rank 10, they may select a new one immediately to begin scaling, and it starts with 1 rank. A Profession goes up in rank every 50 SP, and each Hobby goes up in rank every 100 SP. So they will unlock their second Profession at 450 SP, and both theirr Second Hobby and Third Profession at 900 SP, and so on. Each knowledge skill represents a specific area of expertise that a character can improve upon. These skills might be utilized when interacting with Plot to help tje, discover more information about what is happening during a particular scene, or Plot may choose to ask for Knowledge skills leading into an adventure to help flesh out what the characters might have discovered.
>
>Generally, any piece of information that a player will attempt to discover will be assigned a secret "Difficulty Class" by the Plot member, on a scaling slide of 1 through 10. A Difficulty Class of 1 would represent fairly common knowledge, something that most anyone who cares about the subject would know. A 10 on the other hand would represent particularly unusual or rare information, something that only a true expert in the field would have discovered. If they have enough ranks in the chosen skill to meet the difficulty class, they may learn some useful information. Having less than the set Difficulty may result in incomplete or slightly misleading information, while having more ranks than the required Difficulty may result in getting more detailed or extra information.

## Arcane Knowledge  
Covers Arcane Magic in all its forms and uses. Higher ranks will provide greater insight to Arcane questions or provide more detailed information on the target of an inquiry.

## Criminal Knowledge  
Covers laws (their avoidance and subversion), various criminal organizations and their structure, cons, and illegal activity. Higher ranks will point one to contacts within some of these organizations or reveal information some may regret knowing.

## Economic Knowledge  
Covers trade routes, values of goods, and merchants of specific items. Higher ranks will reveal more hidden information or let someone sniff out particularly good deals.

## Engineering Knowledge
Covers civil engineering and infrastructure such as bridges, aqueducts, walls, buildings, roads, cranes, siege weapons, etc.  It cannot be used to affect game mechanics.  Higher ranks will allow for more detailed insights.

## Geographical Knowledge  
Covers landmarks, terrain, maps, roads, approximate distances, and navigation. Higher ranks will allow for more detailed information or better navigation.

## Historical Knowledge  
Covers recent to far-flung historical events.  Higher ranks will allow for knowledge of the distant past or more accurate recollections of events.

## Nature Knowledge  
Covers Nature Magic in all its forms and uses.  Higher ranks will provide greater insight to Nature questions or provide more detailed information on the target of an inquiry.

## Political Knowledge  
Covers laws (their enforcement and creation), local and foreign political hierarchy, alliances, hostilities, territories, and holdings. Higher ranks will reveal well-hidden information or let one find the truth behind malicious rumors.

## Spirit Knowledge  
Covers Spirit Magic in all its forms and uses. Higher ranks will provide greater insight to Spirit questions or provide more detailed information on the target of an inquiry.

## Survivalist Knowledge  
Covers subjects related to living in the wild, such as hunting, fishing, and identifying plants and animals.  A survivalist may be able to recognize the mark left by a creature, but to truly track them they will need the tracking skill.

## Theology Knowledge  
Covers churches, cults, religious beliefs, deities, and gods. Higher ranks will reveal more in-depth information on various groups or reveal hidden aspects.

## Transform Abilities

### Unlocking Transform Abilities
Before a character may purchase a monstrous ability on their transform, that ability must be "unlocked". Some abilities are unlocked by default (per transform). 

Unlocking an ability requires consuming a number of Spirit Gems dependent on the level of the ability:
* Basic - 1 Spirit Gem
* Advanced - 2 Spirit Gems
* Expert - 3 Spirit Gems
* Master - 4 Spirit Gems
* Grandmaster - 5 Spirit Gems

Mythical Abilities and any ability that specifies a specific component required to unlock, will require casting the Unlock Transform Abilities ritual.

Unlock Transform Abilities is part of the standard ritual library and thus always available to any character that has at least 1 rank of Ritual Magic.

Alternatively, a character may still perform the Unlock Transform Abilities ritual. Doing so reduces the Spirit Gem cost of each ability unlocked by 1 (0 for Basic, 5 for Grandmaster).


#### Unlock Transform Abilities Ritual Scroll
* Each participant in the ritual may benefit from its effect.
* Participants must meaningfully contribute to the roleplay of the ritual, only the caster(s) require ranks of Ritual Magic.
* Ritual is 1st level and requires 1 Spirit Gem to cast plus 1 Spirit Gem for each character to be affected by the ritual.
* Unlocks an arbitrary number of transform abilities for each participant.
* Each ability unlocked requires a number of spirit gems based on the tier of the ability, to be paid by the affected character:
  * Basic - 0 Spirit Gems
  * Advanced - 1 Spirit Gems
  * Expert - 2 Spirit Gems
  * Master - 3 Spirit Gems
  * Grandmaster - 4 Spirit Gems
  * Mythical - 5 Spirit Gems

# NPCs & Benefits

## What is a NPC?

---
A NPC is a Non-Player Character.  In most game systems, this is a fictional character that cannot be played or controlled by a real-world person.  In LARP, every character is controlled by a real-world person, but for us, NPC means that this person is an extension of the plot team.  They are playing a character, a monster, serving as a Ritual Marshal, Game Marshal, or directing a mod for characters.  NPCs might be as simple as a town guard, a wild wolf, a giant beetle, a merchant with exclusive wares, or even a rich noble!

At Chronicles, we LOVE when people volunteer to NPC, because those volunteers help us bring stories to life!  NPCing is also a great way to get a crash course through game systems like combat and magic and explore putting on a new personality.

## What does a NPC do?

---
Most often, a NPC will be asked to assist a Plot member with a mod or story event.  Some of the tasks they might have include dressing up, putting on creature make-up, and serving as a mob or monster meant to challenge the player characters (PCs) on a particular mob.  A NPC might also be what is commonly called a "crunchie".  These are monsters that are often minor or weaker and will directly invade the town or pick off PCs that have wandered off unsafely alone.

Some other tasks may be helping to organize and clean NPC camp, making spell packets, running small mods on their own as a particular kind of NPC such as a merchant, a thief, or a gambler.   NPCs may also be asked to act as a mod-runner for a small group.  This last option is usually only asked of NPCs that have shown they have interest in doing so and have the trust of the plot team to make it a fun experience for the PCs.

## NPC Shifts

---
First, let's start by identifying the two kinds of NPCs:

A **Part Time NPC** is someone that volunteers for a full shift at least one day of the event.  Part Time NPCs also play their characters during the event.  For a Part Time NPC, a full shift is **three hours**.  A Part-Time NPC may work as many hours in a single day as they like.  Each three hour shift is counted as a completed shift.  Rewards can be claimed on a "one shift per single event day" basis.  
>For example, in a three day event, a three hour shift on Friday, six hour shift on Saturday, and a three hour shift on Sunday only counts as three full shifts for the Skill Point or Goblin Point reward.  Because it's a three day event, that particular reward can only be claimed three times.  Mystery Sacks may be claimed for EVERY completed three hour shift.

A **Full Time NPC** is someone that serves as a NPC for the entire event.  They do not play their character at all during the event.  For a Full Time NPC, a full shift is the number of days in an event, which may be two or three.  To be a Full Time NPC, a player must coordinate with Plot ahead of an event.

## Double-Hooking, the Plot Queue, and NPC Shifts

---
Double-hooking is a term used for when two groups of PCs are waiting on Plot for a particular mod and are either asked by Plot or agree Out Of Character (OOC) for each group to serve as NPCs for the other group's mod.  When it comes to the plot team's queue, these groups are very likely to be taken ahead of others because less preparation for handling NPC logistics for a given mod may become much easier when players have two groups ready.

In general, participating in a double-hook does not count towards a Part-Time NPC shift; however, in rare circumstances, such as double-hooking in a mod that runs for the length of a normal Part-Time NPC shift or more, Plot has full discretion to credit a player with a completed shift.  If a player has already completed a shift that day, be sure to clarify what rewards they are gaining, because they might be limited to partial or they may get everything.


## NPC Rewards

---
Aside from the shiny feel-good emotions of having helped out their chapter, Chronicles also gives those that volunteer as NPCs rewards in several forms!  <i>(Please note that while Plot and Staff are likely to have water and snacks at NPC camp, meals at the Tavern are not free to NPCs unless specifically stated by the player running the tavern.)</i>

### Part-Time NPC Rewards
* The player's pick of either 1 Skill Point OR 100 Goblin Points.  This reward may be claimed only once for each completed shift per event day.  If the event is two days, they may claim this twice for six hours or two completed NPC shifts.  If the event is three days, they may claim this three times for nine hours or three completed NPC shifts.

* Mystery Sack.  This is a grab bag reward that will contain one of the following:
  * A bundle of five Tier 1 crafting materials.
  * A single Tier 5 crafting material.
  * A bundle of seven Tier 1 crafting materials.
  * One gold coin.

### Full-Time NPC Rewards
* 400 Goblin Points for a two day event.
* 600 Goblin Points for a three day event.
* Full Skill Point accrual, plus an additional reward of 1 Skill Point per day.
* Free Event Fee.
* Three Mystery Sacks per event day.  These are a grab bag reward that each contain one of the following:
  * A bundle of five Tier 1 crafting materials.
  * A single Tier 5 crafting material.
  * A bundle of seven Tier 1 crafting materials.
  * One gold coin.

### Guest Plot Rewards
* 600 Goblin Points for a two day event.
* 900 Goblin Points for a three day event.
* Full Skill Point accrual, plus an additional reward of 1 Skill Point per day.
* Free Event Fee & Meal Ticket.
* Five Mystery Sacks per event day.  These are a grab bag reward that each contain one of the following:
  * A bundle of five Tier 1 crafting materials.
  * A single Tier 5 crafting material.
  * A bundle of seven Tier 1 crafting materials.
  * One gold coin.

## How Do I Claim Mystery Sacks?

---
Mystery Sacks are automatically filled after the event and can be picked up as part of any production requests during check-in.

# Goblin Points

## Goblin Points - What Are They?

---
Goblin Point (GP) is a type of Out-Of-Character (OOC) currency in Chronicles.  They can be obtained by donation of time, such as event clean-up and NPC shifts or donation of items, such as packets, props, or supplies from the Chronicles Wishlist.  GP can be spent on a variety of things such as crafting materials, death forgiveness, and even Skill Point catch up for missed events.


## How Do I Get Goblin Points?

---
Goblin Points are awarded from plot and/or staff for contributions, donations, and assistance given.  They have a rough equivalent of 10 GP per $1 USD of value; however, a player may not purchase them with direct cash donations.  There are special circumstances where this rate is increased.  One should always check with the plot team and/or staff about any special chapter needs!

## Getting the Most Out of Goblin Points

---
From time to time, the chapter may need some things more than others.  When this is true, specific listings will be tagged as "Needed" or "Critically Needed."  These tags mean that the normal GP awarded for them is increased.

* **"Needed" Items.** These are items that if we do not receive or maintain on a semi-regular basis would impact the game quality significantly. Examples include: Packets, weapons, and tabards.
  * Needed Items award Goblin Points with a x1.5 multiplier.  Example:  15 GP per $1 USD value.
* **"Critically Needed" Items.**  These are items that are in an immediate need in order to continue running the game in the short term sense, we cannot run an event properly without an immediate donation of these items. Examples include: as per Needed, but assuming stock is extremely low, we have run out, all our supplies were lost, or similar.
  * Critically Needed Items award Goblin Points with a x2 multiplier.  Example:  20 Goblin Points per $1 USD Value.



## Donations of Time

---

**1 GP per - <u>Packet Creation during NPC Shift</u>**

* Time spent on packet creation during NPC Shifts is also rewarded!  For every packet crafted during a NPC shift, the player will be rewarded an additional 1 Goblin Point.  For direct packet donation, see <u>Packet Donation</u> under <u>Item Donations</u>

**50 GP - <u>Event Set-Up and Clean-Up</u>**

* Event set-up and clean-up tasks include packet pick-up across the campsite, sweeping and/or mopping (if there is mud), loading or unloading NPC Camp, cleaning or organizing NPC Camp, cleaning dishes, taking trash to the dumpster, returning furniture to its rightful place, and in general, helping ensure that we return the campsite the way we found it or better.  If a player provides this kind of help, be sure to let plot and/or staff know about it.

**50 GP - <u>Post Event Survey</u>**

* After each event is attended, the player will have the option to subject a post-event survey to let staff and plot know about their experience so that they can use the feedback to improve the game overall or address any concerns.

**50-250 GP - <u>Plot Submissions</u>**

* Do you have an idea burning a hole into your head that you think would be a fun addition to Chronicles?  Did you spend time creating something unique and interesting that brings the world within Chronicles to life?  Great!  We love to hear about these and submissions of them, used or not, are rewarded.  This donation of time can include anything from writing mod card ideas, plotline writeups, creating in game news articles, in game artwork, and more!  Please absolutely send these in to [plot@larpchronicles.org](mailto:plot@larpchronicles.org) and be sure to ask how many Goblin Points it's worth!

**100-600 GP - <u>NPC Shifts</u>**

* Goblin Point rewards gained for NPC Shifts differ depending on if someone is a Part Time NPC or a Full Time NPC.  For Part-Time, the option to claim Goblin Points (or a single Skill Point) is dependent on working a full shift of at least 3 hours.  Being a NPC has other rewards as well!  Be sure to read the NPCs & Benefits document for information on rewards, how often they can be claimed, and how to volunteer some time as a Part or Full Time NPC.
    * Part Time NPCs that work a full three hour shift can choose between 100 Goblin Points OR 1 additional Skill Point.  Regardless of the number of completed shifts, this may only be claimed once per event day and only if additional Skill Points are not claimed.  Assuming they have worked a full NPC shift for each event day, if an event is two days (six hours worked), they can choose to claim at most 200 GP or for three day events (nine hours worked), 300 GP at most.
    * A Full Time NPC that works the entire event is awarded 400 GP.  This does not apply to any player that PCs during the event.  For three day events, this is 600 GP.

**!?! GP - <u>Physical Representation Creation or Repair</u>**

* "Phys-rep" creation can include the creation of claw boffers, swords, shields, and/or props.  This donation of time does not require anyone to also provide the supplies and is rewarded as deemed by Plot and/or staff based on participation.  For already completed phys-rep donations, see Physical Representation Donation under <u>Item Donations</u>

**!?! GP - <u>Special Event Assistance</u>**

* From time to time, plot may ask one or more people for assistance in running mods outside of a NPC Shift.  This type of time donation qualifies as special event assistance and the amount of Goblin Points it rewards can vary greatly depending on the task asked!


## Item Donations

---
**10 GP - <u>Packet Supplies</u> (per $1)**

* Donations of packet supplies are valued at 10GP to $1 spent, rounded up.  This means if a player spends $9.34 on packet supplies, it will count as $10 and they will be given 100 GP.  Do they have packets already made?  Check out <u>Packet Donation</u> below!  Packet supplies should conform to the following:
    * **Fabric** - Cut or uncut white fabric that is a biodegradable natural fiber fabric. (Cotton, abaca, bamboo, lyocell, ramie, jute, hemp, silk.)  Please do not donate nylon, fleece, acrylic, polyester, or rayon fabrics for packets.
    * **Rubber bands** - Size #32-33 is preferred (1/8"). Must be natural rubber.
    * **Birdseed** - Millet bird seed or bird seed that does **not** contain sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.

**10 GP per $1 -<u> Physical Representation Supplies</u>**

*  Supplies for phys-reps donations are rewarded with 10 Goblin Points per $1 USD value, rounded up.  This means if a player spends $9.34 on phy-rep supplies, it will count as $10 and they will be given 100 GP.  Not sure what kind of supplies to donate?  Here is a short list of preferred supplies:
    * Ultralight Cores of carbon fiber, kitespar tube, fiberglass tube, or wrapped graphite tube.  Aluminum cores are only used for polearms.  Diameter should be between .414-.610".
    * Closed Cell Foam.  This can be pipe foam insulation and pool noodles and is used to pad the "blade" of a boffer.  It should have a wall of at least 5/8" thick.
    * Open Cell Foam.  Used for boffer tips, this is a less dense foam commonly found in fabric stores as fill for pillows or in hardware stores as pipe foam.
    * Kite Tape or nylon rip stop repair tape.  Preferred vendor - [FunWithWind](https://funwithwind.com/store/ListCategoriesAndProducts2.asp?idCategory=186&idparent=171)
    * [Dap Weldwood Contact Cement](https://www.amazon.com/00271-Weldwood-Original-Contact-Cement/dp/B0006MXRY8/ref=pd_di_sccai_2?pd_rd_w=gdI93&pf_rd_p=c9443270-b914-4430-a90b-72e3e7e784e0&pf_rd_r=NXDNHRFGZV673SHKBQWS&pd_rd_r=377eca45-f83c-4a21-a00f-3b4859ff9ab9&pd_rd_wg=MvJFD&pd_rd_i=B0006MXRY8&psc=1)
    * [EVA Foam](https://www.foambymail.com/XPE2/cross-linked-polyethylene-foam-2lb.html)
    * Duct tape or strapping tape.

**10 GP per $1 - <u>Chronicles Amazon Wishlist Item(s)</u>**

* If a player makes a donation through the chapter's [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/28K7OWJ8ZWO60?ref_=wl_share), make sure that plot and/or staff are aware that it is coming from them – also so that they know to watch for the package!  Anything purchased from the Wishlist is worth 10 GP per $1, rounded up.  This means if they spend $9.34 on packet supplies, it will count as $10 and they will be given 100 GP.  If an item the player purchased for the Chapter from the Wishlist has a comment of "Needed" or "Critically Needed," then they will be granted extra GP as detailed at the top of this document.

**50 GP per 25 - <u>Packet Donation (25 count)</u>**

* Each count of 25 packets rewards 50 GP.  Do note that packet material must be a biodegradable, natural fiber cloth of approx 6"x6".  Any color is acceptable, but there is a strong preference for white fabric, because it can be easier to find with UV flashlights, making post-mod clean up much easier.  Packet contents should be seeds and must not contain sharp seeds such as sunflower seeds.  Millet is highly suggested for packet contents.  For donation of time during an event to create packets with provided supplies, please see Packet Creation in <u>Donations of Time</u>

**!?! GP - <u>Physical Representation</u>**

* Completed "phys-rep" donations can include the claw boffers, swords, shields, costumes, costume jewelry, and/or props.  Donation of these items is rewarded per item and starts at 10 GP.  Higher quality donations are rewarded with more GP at the discretion of plot and/or staff.  Always confirm the reward total at the time of donation!

# Standing Policies

## Transfer Policy

### Character Conversion from Other LARP Systems

---
* You may import your LARP character to Chronicles ONCE.  This is available to players from LARP Systems such as NERO or Alliance LARP, or similarly recognized systems.
* You may choose to have your character transported to Evren from another world (keeping your character's memories and history), OR you may choose to use your skill points to create an entirely new, Evren-based character.
* Importing your character does not invalidate your membership with other LARP organizations or your characters.
* Attending Chronicles events will have no impact on your character in other LARP Systems.
* After conversion, attending non-Chronicles LARP events will have no impact on your Chronicles character.
* All build points transfer to Chronicles as Skill Points.  If this number is below one hundred, you will start with one hundred Skill Points in Chronicles.
* Transforms _may_ transfer into Chronicles, at the discretion of the plot team, on a per-case basis.

### Money, Gems & Items

---
* Coins, gems, and/or bank values from other LARP Systems do not transfer to Chronicles.
* Magic items and/or production items from other LARP Systems do not transfer to Chronicles.


### Goblin Points

Goblin Points from other LARP Systems do not transfer to Chronicles, but we do have our own Goblin Point reward system you can participate in.


## Code of Conduct & Disciplinary Rules

While we never hope this to be the case, if anyone is breaking Chronicles rules, the Code of Conduct, violating the rules of the rental site, or causing problems and/or disruptions to the event, they will be subject to an escalating response from Plot and Staff.  This is outlined with more detail in the [Code of Conduct](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rn8_-PmbtBhRNPs0cJDY6ccTxmmNL0Sr?usp=share_link).

## COVID Precautions

We follow guidelines from the CDC and the state of Illinois.  Please get your vaccinations.  If you feel sick, stay home.

Face masks are welcome.  NPC Camp/Logistics will have N95 and KN95 masks available at check in.

### Covid Tests
(As of 2023-03-01)

We are not requiring the submission of negative COVID tests.  Testing remains encouraged in order to protect yourself and the members of our community that are immunocompromised or high-risk.

COVID Resources, How to get Tests, and Test Submission info can be found here: http://larpchronicles.com/covid


## Summer Armor & Make-up Policy
In cases of extreme weather, staff may declare special exceptions for armor and make-up requirements.

For armor, this would allow players to have their full armor points based on the assessment of their armor reps during check in, but would not require them to wear all armor pieces.

For make up, this would lift the requirement of full face make up, so long as the character's race is still clearly represented.

# Casting Spells
Casting a spell is an act of will and physical effort combined, gathering the energy that the caster has prepared in their memory and then throwing it out into the world. In LARP Chronicles, a spell’s energy is represented by a “spell packet”, a small bundle of cloth, usually filled with bird seed, that is thrown at, or touched against other participants, in order to use your magic.
 
When casting a spell, first you must have a spell packet in hand. Then, you cast the spell by stating the incant, each spell having its own unique incant, and then either touching the packet to the intended target, or throwing it. If your spell packet strikes a target successfully, they are affected as per the spell’s description, unless they are capable of resisting the magic. If you are touching the target directly, they have the ability to “refuse your touch cast”, causing you to expend the magic to no effect  
**A note on touch casting**:  Any spell may be touch cast. The target of a touch cast spell may refuse the touch cast, so long as they are capable of movement. Any and every offensive or negative touch cast spell is assumed to automatically be refused unless explicitly accepted by the target.  
You must be careful when casting spells, because if an enemy is within reach, or they have a ranged weapon, you risk your spell being disrupted mid-cast if they manage to strike you with a weapon blow, or if you take damage from any source during the incant. If your spell is disrupted, it is lost and you must complete a rest to recover it.

Some spells require a “X count” to cast where X may be three or five.  This is always intended to be X number of seconds.

Rarely, you may encounter entities that are capable of delivering magic quicker than normal, skipping the incantation and abridging it to simply Magic followed by the spell name, for example, Magic Fear. This is still an effective spell, and needs to be reacted to as such. Similarly, some entities may deliver a spell via “Voice Radius,” at which time anyone who can hear the declared spell, whether enemy or ally, is subject to it as if they’d been struck by the spell directly. Finally, powerful creatures can sometimes deliver a spell as an Aether spell. If you are struck by an Aether spell, no resistances can prevent the effect, and you are affected by it immediately.

# Magical Skills

## Mastery Skills

A Mastery skill is purchased in order to grant a character access to a school of magic. The skill itself is the prerequisite for purchasing your first Mana Attunement of the given school, and provides a passive benefit that may be used.

### Arcane Mastery

This skill allows the character to spend one minute of concentration to attune themselves to the flow of Evren’s Aether in order to detect magic by simply touching an item or person. Once the character has achieved attunement, the character may continue to detect magic until their concentration is broken. This detect magic ability will reveal the presence of magic on an item, or person, and the type of magic that is present. There does exist some magic able to fool even these extraordinary senses. 


### Spiritual Mastery

This skill allows the character to briefly sense the presence of recently untethered spirits. A character skilled in Spiritual Mastery can also attempt to speak with the still tethered spirit of the recently deceased. To attempt a communication with the dead, the character must concentrate for one minute and roleplay contact with the body of the dead. While in contact with the body and still in concentration, the character may speak with the spirit of the dead. This skill does not halt the death count of the dead character and the communication immediately ends when the spirit becomes untethered.

### Natural Mastery
This skill allows the character the occasional ability to sense extreme danger, possibly even gaining temporary sight from a nearby animal in a position to warn the character. The character with the skill Natural Mastery cannot control these abilities, it is entirely up to the Plot Team to determine when the character receives these warnings and visions.



# Mana Attunement

In order to cast a spell, you must possess the appropriate Mastery skill, and purchase ranks of Mana Attunement. Each rank of Mana Attunement you purchase in a given school gives you 10 Points of Mana, which may be spent to cast any spell from that school, on a 1:1 basis, where Mana is equivalent to a spell rank. So after your first attunement is purchased, you could cast 10 Rank I spells, or 2 Rank V spells, or any other combination adding up to 10. These spells can be chosen on the fly, allowing for spell casters to be highly flexible. Some may prefer to Memorize their spells in advance, giving them a clearer guide on what they are capable of. If a character chooses to use Memorization, they gain a bonus 10% to their Mana Pool, so someone with a single Mana Attunement who Memorizes would have 11 Mana, or someone with 5 Attunements would have 55 Mana that they could assign to their Memorized spells.

If the caster’s concentration is interrupted, or the reforming body is affected by any detrimental effect, the spell fails and the target immediately suffers a second death. Prior to the casting time the player of the caster, and the player of the untethered spirit, are to verify that the spirit does not have too much strain to resurrect. A marshal should also be present to oversee the process. Once the Resurrection spell is complete, the spirit instantly reforms its body next to the spell caster. The body appears with a full health pool, and all skills renewed as if they had completed a long rest.  This is a LIFE effect. |
